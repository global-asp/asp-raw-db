desc:	There are seven life processes of all living things. Examples of living things include people

page_text:

P1	Living things are able to move.@@Animals can move their limbs to run away from danger.@@Plants can move their flowers and leaves to the sun.@@Children can move by hopping on one leg.
P2	All living things respire or breathe turning food into energy.@@Animals and humans eat food and breathe in oxygen to create energy and breathe out a gas called carbon dioxide.@@When we run we breathe in and out much faster.@@Plants change the energy they get from the carbon dioxide taken in through their leaves  from sunlight into oxygen.
P3	Living things respond to the outside world. We call this sensitivity.@@Humans make fires when they are cold.@@Plants wilt when they do not get water.@@Elephants swim in rivers when they are hot.
P4	Living things have babies to survive.@@@Fish, frogs and birds lay eggs.@@Plants and trees produce seeds to make new plants and trees.@@Humans have babies.
P5	All living things eat food.@@Some animals eat grass, others eat meat.@@Vegetables need to be planted in soil and need sun and water to grow.@@Food gives us energy.
P6	Living things need to get rid of waste products.  @@In animals, kidneys and lungs  are some of the ways in which waste products are released.@@Snakes often shed all their skin at one time and it comes off as if they have taken off a coat.@@Plants have small openings on their leaves called stomata to release oxygen.
P7	All living things grow until they have reached their full size, strength, and with the ability to make new babies.@@Growth is also important to replace damaged cells, like when we fall and hurt ourselves.
P8	The seven life processes are movement, respiration, sensitivity, reproduction, nutrition, excretion and growth.@@If something can do all these seven life processes, they are alive!
