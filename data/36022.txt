desc:	It is a time when only Owl has sun

page_text:

P1	In the old days there were two people, Gatari and Owl. Owl owned the sun, water and fire. Gatari did not have any of these things and lived in@  darkness with his family.
P2	Your adapted text@  Gatari tried to make a garden, but he could not grow vegetables@  because there was no sun. Everybody suffered because there was no sun. When@  they hunted animals to eat, they hung the meat in the trees to dry, but it@  rotted because there was no sun.
P3	Your adapted text@  Gatari crept closer to the sun while he was dancing. Owl held on to@  the sun but after a while he forgot about it because he enjoyed the dancing@  so much. He saw how beautifully Gatari danced. He@  too wanted to dance like this.
P4	Your adapted text@  Suddenly, Gatari@  took his fighting stickÂ  and hit the sun into@  the air like a ball. The sun travelled so far that it remained forever in the@  sky. It gave everyone light all day.
P5	Your adapted text
P6	Owl said to his wife, "Go and look in my@  bag and fetch the moon." Owl held the moon high above his shoulders and@  it lit up the darkness for all to see the dance. While they were dancing, Gatari moved closer and closer to the moon, for he had a@  plan.
P7	Your adapted text
P8	Your adapted text@  They clapped the whole day long. The rhythm of@  the clapping made Owl forget all about the firesticks.@  When they swung around onto his chest once more, Gatari@  grabbed the firesticks and ran away. Owl and his@  family ran after Gatari, but he made a clever plan.@  He had a bag full of thorns and threw them onto the ground behind him. This@  stopped Owl and his family from chasing him. They could not cross the thorns@  on the path.
P9	Your adapted text@  Gatari could not wait to make fire. He rubbed and rubbed the sticks.@  He blew and blew the ember in a little dry grass until a tiny flame appeared.@  The fire grew and lit the whole veld and each time the flames reached a tree,@  Gatari said, "From now on people will be able@  to make a fire with each tree on earth."
P10	Your adapted text@  Gatari pretended to leave for his home, but he secretly turned round@  to the place of water. He turned the huge pot over so that the water started@  flowing on the ground. Gatari quickly jumped over@  the flowing water to the other side. Then he was safely across the river of@  water where Owl could not find him.
P11	Your adapted text@  This is why the whole earth has rivers full of@  water today. This is why we have the sun, moon and fire, because of the@  magician Gatari.
P12	Your adapted text@  Story notes In 2003, Katunga@  Carimbwe told this version of the Gatari and Owl origin story to Titu@  Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg@  in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa while he was busy painting on a@  canvas. Mangumbu, Mahongo@  and Winberg translated it and retold the story in@  this written version with as few alterations as possible. His elders told the@  story to him during his childhood in Mavinga,@  Angola, where he was born in 1958. Most of the episodes in the Gatari and Owl myth have a wide distribution in the@  extensive area of southern Africa and the Kalahari whose original inhabitants@  speak!Xun and other@  closely related languages, although the names and identities of the@  trickster, Gatari, and his adversary change from@  area to area. The "clapping game" mentioned in our version, Gatari and Owl, is still current among the!xun, the Nharo,@  and possibly other communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Gatari as a culture hero and transformer of the primeval@  world into the present world. He achieves this with words, "From now on@  people will be able to make a fire with each tree on earth." The Manyeka Arts Trust holds a!Xun audio telling of this story by Meneputo Mnaunga Maneka in archive. The illustrations in this story are@  from story boards by Marlene Winberg interpreted@  digitally by Satsiri Winberg@  through manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection@  of paintings made by San artists /Thaalu Rumao, /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wenne Dikuango, who have all passed away since.
