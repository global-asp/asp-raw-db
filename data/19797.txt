She was lonely.  One time it was exams and she did not revise the exams came and she failed. The other students laughed.   A girl  called  Amina came and from now on I will your friend and the teacher  told them  not to laugh and Sofie  cried. The students were in punishment and when the bell rang for home time,   her mum came for her  and she told her that the students had laughed at her.
