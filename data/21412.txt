P1	The day that we’re waiting for is coming. It’s going to be Chiefs versus Aces on this very field. 
Come and watch! Come with your vuvuzela!
P2	“Chiefs, the cup must come to sleep at home,” said Coach. “I want us to work together as a team to defeat the Aces. We must attack cleverly, defend well, and pass to each other.”
P3	Soon we were practising hard. 
“Pass the ball, pass it, Portia Modise!”
“Defend, defend, Jomo!”
“There it is, there it is, into the goals!”
Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
P4	“You played wonderfully, my beautiful Chiefs!
You attacked cleverly, you defended well, and you passed to each other. You played as a real team!”
P5	“High five to all of you! Well done!” said Coach.
P6	We went home really tired, but the practice was good.

“When is the real match, Coach?” we asked.
P7	Finally the day came. 
“Halala Chiefs, halala! It’s going to be a good game. The cup is ours!” said Coach. 
Po-o-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o! Po-o-o-o-o! sounded the vuvuzela.
P8	And then there was a surprise. 

“What beautiful kit!  Thank you, Coach. We play the best, and now we also look the best!”
