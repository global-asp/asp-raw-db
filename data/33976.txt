page_text:

P1	My name is Anne. I am the third child at home. I live with my loving and caring mom and my wonderful sisters.@@I do not have a brother. I always ask myself how was it going to be like to have an overprotective brother and a sister-in-law.
P2	My younger sister, Janet, fell pregnant. We were heart broken. Her pregnancy did not sit well with mom since she was a single parent. She had a heart attack and passed away before the baby was born.
P3	Our hearts were once again broken. Janet was due in three months. Mom did not have a chance to hold her sixth grandchild. It was going to be fun, though we were heart broken at first. Any how, a baby is a precious gift from God.
P4	After three months, Janet gave birth to an adorable baby boy. I was over the moon. I could not sleep at night. I would look at him and think to myself, what a lovely gift from above. And I wish mom was here to see this beauty by herself.
P5	I named him Terrence. He has brought sunshine into my life. He is such an angel but his addition into the family did not replace mom. Terrence likes to giggle and he has the cutest smile the world has never seen. He is my bundle of joy.
