P1	One day Little Dog was playing with a ball.
P2	He saw a cat. He said,  "Hello,  Little Cat. Can I play with you?" Little Cat said,  "I will play with you. Can I play with your ball?"
P3	"Yes," said Little Dog. "It is a red ball. I will kick it to you and you can hit it back to me."
P4	So the two little friends began to play. Little Dog said,  "I like to play with you. It is fun. You are a good friend."
P5	The big red ball went over the wall. Little Cat began to cry. "We do not have a ball to play with."
P6	"I like to play with the big red ball," said Little Cat. Little Cat began to cry and cry.
P7	"I will get the ball," said Little Dog and he jumped over the wall.
P8	Soon he was back with the ball. Little Cat was happy that it was back. The two friends played and played.
P9	Little Dog said,  "Come to my house and let us look at a picture book." In the picture book,  they saw a little dog play ball with a little cat!
