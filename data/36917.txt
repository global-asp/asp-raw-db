P1	Coach Thandi called the children from our village, and said that she would like for us to be a part of her soccer team.
P2	So she selected 11 kids in the village and took us to a soccer field. We were divided into three groups, group one was the strikers, group two were the mid-fielders and group three were our defenders.
P3	Coach Thandi showed us how to play in these positions. She also told us that she would be getting us soccer uniforms and boots. We were all so excited and couldn't wait to get our soccer gear.
P4	Daily we would all meet at the soccer field, where we did a whole lot of running and most of us were unfit. Coach really trained us hard. Some days I couldn't breathe from all the running however with each passing day it become easier and now it's a breeze.
P5	Our first tournament, boy!... were we excited. We all looked really smart in our soccer gear. Before our match had started we took many photos.
P6	I was really nervous and didn't want us to lose that game or to disappoint coach Thandi after all the hard work she had put in.
P7	Finally the match starts and in the first two minutes of our game the opposing team scores their first goal. It's half-time and we still haven't scored a goal. Back in the locker room coach Thandi was as cool as a cucumber. She gave us pointers and had a strategic game plan.
P8	Half-time is over and we back on the field and all coach Thandi keeps screaming is for us to enjoy the game. I thought coach was crazy because we haven't scored a single goal as yet. As the game continues I started to relax and enjoyed the game by the time the final whistle was blown we had scored two goals.
P9	We won that tournament and our pictures were taken and we had a big celebration thereafter. I would like to encourage all kids to follow their dreams and never give up, no matter what.
