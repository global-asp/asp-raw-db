P1	There are shoes for all occasions.
P2	Shoes when the sun shines go 'flip-flop'.
P3	Shoes for ladies going to a party go 'clip-clop'.
P4	Shoes for girls and boys going to school go 'tough-turf'.
P5	Shoes for daddies going to work go 'shift-shaft'.
P6	My favourite shoes are those I wear at home. Those go 'fush-fush'.@@They are soft. They hug my feet.
P7	They are cleaner than my brother's muddy gumboots.
P8	They are prettier than my sister's smelly running shoes.@@My shoes are for when you are relaxed, with no cares in the world.
