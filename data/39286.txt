page_text:

P1	It was a beautiful day, it was sunny and all the flowers were blooming ,birds were singing , butterfly's are happy
P2	It was getting stormy,and she went ,butterflies flew away and it was not sunny anymore.
P3	Then it was about to rain so she wanted to go back home
P4	When she was going she slipped and fell unconscious.
P5	She woke up and injured herself and her family and friends were sad ,she was still holding that flower she saw outside.
P6	She is still holding that flower, I think that the flower made her feel better and she was a little happy
