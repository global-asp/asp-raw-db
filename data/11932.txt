page_text:

P1	One early morning,  Ekai was woken up by his mother. He was in a deep sleep and he could not wake up immediately.
P2	His mother kept calling him,  "Ekai! Ekai-i-i." Ekai was very annoyed because that was unusual thing to him.
P3	His mother had prepared breakfast for him and warm water for bathing. Ekai woke up,  took a bath and breakfast.
P4	Ekai's mother brought him new school uniform and a pair of black shoes with grey pair of socks. He was surprised to see his father holding a blue bag full of books. He knew that his time to start school had reached.
P5	Ekai and his father left the house. He waved to his mother and held his father's hand. They walked to the bus stop. They found a bus that was ready to leave. They boarded the bus. After a few minutes,  they reached a place where there were many buildings and children.
P6	The gate was opened for them by a man who dressed like a policeman. Ekai was afraid of the man and the environment. He could see many children playing and others were singing. The place looked strange to him!
P7	They entered one of the buildings and found a well-dressed tall man. The man greeted them and asked Ekai his name. The man wrote down his name and his age in a big black book. Ekai saw many writings on the wall and beautiful things like flower vases on the cupboard.
P8	The man took him to a building where there were small children like him. There was also a lady like her mother,  writing on a big black wall. He knew that the lady was the teacher.
P9	The teacher taught them how to count numbers and new songs on numbers. She also taught them on how to play with toys.
P10	The bell rang and everyone took his or her bag and ran towards the gate. Ekai was surprised to see his father at the gate waiting for him. He held his hand and they went home.
P11	Ekai wondered how all these events took place just in a day.
