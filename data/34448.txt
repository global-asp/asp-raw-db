P1	Once upon a time,there lived a boy his name was Wanjohi.He lived with his mother, grandmother and great grandmother (Wacera).They lived in a town called kiandutu in the slum.
P2	Wacera had lost her eyesight due to old age,so anytime Wanjohi's mother and grandmother were not around,Wanjohi was taking care of her.Wanjohi loved reading when free,he read several stories in a day.One afternoon, Wanjohi's mother was on
P3	duty and the grandmother had gone to the market.It was raining very heavily,Wanjohi was in his room reading while Wacera lay by the fire side to keep warm because it was very cold
P4	Wanjohi had an argue to poop,in the slum their houses were so squeezed ask the toilets were built at the far end of there houses.He couldn't go outside as the rain was so heavy.He looked through the window and wondered what to do.
P5	An idea crossed his mind that he would poop on a newspaper and throw it outside the window but it couldn't work as it was day time.He took a newspaper,tip toed to the corner of the house,Wacera could hear movements he ignored her.
P6	He used the newspaper to poop on,folded it,tip toed to where they keep the dust bin and hid at the bottom and covered it with other trush in the bin.Wacera couldn't understand the movement in the house,she kept calling Wanjohi but he did
P7	Not respond, Wanjohi left his room.Wacera sensed the bad smell and wondered what that could be.In the evening,the grandmother returned from the market.The moment She entered the house.she couldn't stand the smell, Wacera agreed with her.
P8	That there was a bad smell in the house.She searched everywhere but could not get to where the smell came from.Wanjohi's mother joined them from work.She too joined them in the game 4 searching,she had a good sense of smell.
P9	She traced were the smell was coming from.She took the dustbin, emptied it and to her surprise there was roll of newspaper that had the poop.She called out that there was a witch trying to be witch them.Ir was a shock to everyone and they
P10	All believed it was witch craft.They carried it out to burn and called all the neighbors to join them in prayers against the witch craft.They sang as they burnt it and the men and women went around the house sprinkling water and rebuking
P11	The demon they prayed to God to kill the witch.Wanjohi was believed to be  the most educated, therefore he would pray in English and God would listen to his prayer.Wanjohi was given the chance to pray and he was shaken because at the back
P12	Of his mind he knew it was not witch craft but still he couldn't bring himself to confess what he did.He prayed "Please God protect as from whoever did this,I mean of course you know best, heavenly Father but maybe this time it was not a
P13	Demon, just forgive"they all said in Union Amen.That night he quietly prayed,"God am sorry for all I did,and for all the pain and suffering caused."
