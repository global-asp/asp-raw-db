page_text:

P1	My father was brilliant and caring man. During festive season he would tell us history of Bantwane culture,  and where they originate.
P2	My father was working at Kroondal Platinum Mine in Rustenburg,  He used to come home once a year in festive season. On the second day of the arrival he would slaughter the goat with my uncle Mokgoshi and make a big feast.
P3	He used to put me on his lap when he tell us stories. One day he told us to study more than one degree because the economy of this country is volatile,  one will seek employment and forced to compromise his/her qualification.
P4	I remember my father. Indeed life is short.
P5	My father was trapped in a mine for two weeks,  without food and water.
P6	The rescue team did what they can however it was not enough or should i say "too little too late."
P7	Respect life and practice safety at all times.
P8	My father left not only his family behind but the the legacy.
P9	Value what you have and use it efficiency,  My father provided everything that i desire. His  warmth hug,  i still remember his smell - the strawberry fragrance. He was taller than anyone i know at Ntwane village.
P10	The last time i saw my father he said that "keep your head up,  the world can be mean to you."
