page_text:

P1	Reabetswe and Rebone are visiting the National Botanical Gardens. @@There are many different types of plants and insects in the gardens.  Rebone notices two honeybees and screams with fright. "Stop it!" scolds his sister.@ @"Remember the story father told us? He had to go to hospital after being stung by bees," whispers Rebone.@ @Reabetswe replies, "They only stung him because he disturbed their hive. It was self-defense!"
P2	Reabetswe loves bees. She knows a lot about these useful insects.@@She says to Rebone, "I bet you don't know anything about bee communication!" Rebone looks bored and yawns.@@"Wena, Mr Smarty Pants, you should learn from me!" she responds with irritation. @@Reabetswe continues, "Bees communicate about building and protecting their hive. They communicate about their work, finding food, and finding a mate. A lot like humans!"
P3	Rebone pretends he isn't listening, but then asks her, "Do they communicate by buzzing?" @@"No! They communicate with a waggle dance! And they communicate by shaking their bodies" says Reabetswe dancing along the garden path.@@Rebone looks at her doubtfully. "Serious?" he asks.@@"Yes. And they also communicate by special chemicals, which their bodies produce," calls back Reabetswe as she dances ahead.
P4	"Z-z-z, the whole day! They must get tired of buzzing!" teases Rebone, catching up with his sister.@@"The buzzing noise is actually the sound of their wings when they are flying," says Reabetswe.@@"Hey, I know something about bees!" Rebone wants to boast about what he remembers from his life sciences class. @@Reabetswe stands with her hands on her hips, and waits.
P5	"When a bee visits a flower to collect nectar, the pollen from the flower sticks to the bee's legs and body," says Rebone.@@"When that bee visits another flower, it moves the pollen onto the new flower. The seeds are in the pollen. That's how bees help plants to spread their seeds," he concludes. @@Reabetswe calmly nods, "Yes, it's called pollination. Bees help to pollinate flowers."
P6	She adds, "Plants need bees so they can exchange their seeds and reproduce, and grow new plants. We need bees for our food crops to grow." @@Rebone walks ahead, thinking to himself, "That's true. Bees are important. And they have other benefits as well. Let me see if Ms Clever remembers." @@Rebone turns back to talk to his sister. She is day-dreaming, watching bees visiting flowers.
P7	"Reabetswe, hey, stop chasing after bees and hurry up!" calls Rebone. @@She walks with big strides to catch up with her brother. He asks, "Bees pollinate our plants, and they also have other benefits. Can you remember the three products that we get from bees?"@@They look at each other for a moment, and then laugh as they both start answering at the same time.
P8	"Bees produce honey, wax and propolis!" they chant in unison.@@They high-five one another, proud that they remembered their lessons so well.@@"Come on, Genius, let's find mom and dad, I'm hungry," Reabetswe says to her brother.@@"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" asks Rebone as his eyes light up.@@They both shout at the same time, "Scones and honey!"
