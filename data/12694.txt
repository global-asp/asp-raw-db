page_text:

P1	One day I met Agnes. She is a very good English teacher.
P2	She walks using crutches on both sides of the arms.
P3	When I went for the music show,  I met with Mosa. He is a music DJ at all shows.
P4	Mosa has albinism. He has problems with his eyes.
P5	My neighbour is Ms. Nerima. Her legs are crippled but is a prominent farmer in the village.
P6	Mosa has a problem with hearing. He speaks with Sign language.
P7	Mosa is the best soccer player in the whole village. I like watching him play.
P8	Mosa had an accident with his hands. But he can win matches with his feet!
P9	Now I know that even people with challenges can do anything!
P10	I will tell my friend Jackie not to give up.
P11	Hurray! We can all do everything in life! No one is disable in this world.
