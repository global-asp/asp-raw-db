P1	This is Mama's garden. It is big and beautiful. Mama plants many crops in it.
P2	This is a mango tree Mama planted. The mangoes are ripe and look juicy. They make me salivate.
P3	Mama and I visit Mama's garden to get maize for roasting. Sometimes, Mama goes to sell the maize at the market.
P4	Mama's garden has big pumpkins and tomatoes. There is one giant pumpkin I like looking at.
P5	The neighbour's cows are feeding on Mama's sweet potato vines. Mama will be so angry when she finds out.
P6	Mama also plants sugarcane. My friends and I love to play hide and seek in the sugarcane.
