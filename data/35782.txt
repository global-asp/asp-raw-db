page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a farmer who had two young boys. They were twins. Their names were Alexander and Benjamin. @@Their favorite meal was rice. Every day after school they visit their father on the farm.
P2	Every day their father gave them rice to take home. @@Alongside the road to the farm lived Monkey. @@Monkey loved to eat rice too.
P3	Whenever Alexander and Benjamin passed the trees where Money lived, he threatened them. @@He said, "You little boys, give me what you have in that basket. If you don't give it to me I'll hurt you!"
P4	Alexander and Benjamin were very scared. They gave Monkey the basket and he ate the rice eagerly. Monkey told the boys not to tell their father. @@Monkey did this everyday but the boys were too scared to tell their father.
P5	Their father saw that Alexander and Benjamin became slimmer every day and asked them why. @@"Monkey lives alongside the road to the farm and he takes our rice every day and eats it," cried Alexander.
P6	"He says if we don't give him the rice, he will hurt us, " said Benjamin crying. @@"Why didn't you tell me?" their father asked frowning.
P7	"Monkey says we should not tell you," Alexander and Benjamin said. @@"Didn't I tell you not to keep secrets from me?" father asked.
P8	Alexander and Benjamin remembered that their father said that. @@"I will show you how to trick Money," father said.
P9	The next day Alexander and Benjamin carried a bigger basket with them. @@When they reached the trees where Monkey lived he jumped out into the road.
P10	Monkey threatened the boys again. "You little boys, give me what you have in that basket. If you don't, I will hurt you."@@Alexander and Benjamin gave Monkey the basket.
P11	When Monkey opened the basket, a big dog jumped out and bit him on his arm. @@Monkey cried in pain and ran into the forest.
P12	Since that day, Monkey was never seen again. @@The boys grew up and became strong farmers.
