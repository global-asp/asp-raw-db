page_text:

P1	Sian was a little elephant. She lived in Olemelepo village.
P2	She was always asking questions. @"Mum, can I go to the river today?" she asked her mother. "The crocodiles will eat you. Do not go near the river,"  said her mother.
P3	"I will have to visit the river," She said to herself.
P4	A bird called Sinante was a friend to Sian.
P5	Sian asked Sinante to take her to the river. Sinante told her that  the river is unsafe for children.
P6	One day, Sian went to the river alone. The river was calm and she asked herself why her mother wouldn't allow her to visit the beautiful place.
P7	She saw something in the water.
P8	Sian got worried. She remembered that her mother had told her that the crocodiles in the river would eat her.
P9	"My name is Tukero. Do not fear me. I won't eat you. I want us to be friends," The crocodile said to Sian.
P10	Sian was very happy because she had made a new friend.
P11	Suddenly, Tukero the crocodile attacked Sian and bit her small nose. He pulled her nose.@He pulled and pulled. Sian cried for help. Her nose became very long.
P12	Luckily, Tukero let her go and she fell on the ground. From that day, Sian decided to always obey her mother.
P13	She was happy that the crocodile had not eaten her even though her nose had become very long. She used the trunk to fetch water and played with it on her way back home.
P14	She also used her trunk to pick fruits high up the tree.
P15	From that day, elephants have long trunks.
