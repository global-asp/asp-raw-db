page_text:

P1	I am Juliana.I am eight years old I like performing my housework chores. Am sweeping the our house.I have found two rats in our kitchen. My brother is afraid of the rats and has run away to find safety beside the dog.
P2	This is my mother. Her name is Maria.I like escorting her to the market every Saturday. She does business in Kioge market.
P3	This is Kioge market. My mother has her grocery in this market. She usually sells oranges and at times bananas. At some time she also sells vegetables. She has Mr Okello who usually operates the grocery on my mothers behalf.
P4	There are many people in Kioge market. Some people come to buy goods whereas others come to sell. Kioge market is divided into sections according to what it sells.I have decided to have a walk around the market with my mother.
P5	This is my mothers farm. She usually cultivates it. This is where she gets the vegetables that she sells at the market. She is training me on how to pick vegetables.
P6	My mother bought me a small kid.I named the kid Popo. My brother did not have interest on goats but developed it after my mother bought it for me.
P7	Soon the kid grew into a goat. It sired two other kids.I gave one to my brother.I usually feed our goats with grass together with my brother.
P8	My mother was glad to see that Popo had sired two other kids. She sold the two goats and used the money to pay for our school fees. My mother loves us so much that she does not want us to be sent home from school for school fees. She used the other money to buy us food and uniforms. Our mother takes care of us. We really love her very much.
