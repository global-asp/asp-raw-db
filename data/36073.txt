page_text:

P1	One day after a heavy rain, Iman looked across the sky and saw colours in it for the first time.
P2	"How beautiful," she thought. @@Someone must have worked very hard, painting the sky with a brush like Daddy paints houses.
P3	She ran to her sister and said, "Zarah look! Someone has painted the sky for us and made it beautiful."
P4	But Zarah said, "No, silly. That is a rainbow. You are little and I am big. I know why it is in the sky. Let me show you."
P5	Zarah took Iman to the zoo. @@She said, "Rainbows do not appear because lion cubs roar for the first time or because elephants are born."
P6	She took Iman to a field of flowers and said, "They do not appear because butterflies lose their colours in the clouds."
P7	She showed Iman a book. @@She said, "They do not even appear because rhinos run across the ground and scare colours up into the sky."
P8	"I know why rainbows really appear. Mummy told me and now I'll tell you." @@Zarah took Iman's hand and led her to a playground.
P9	"Rainbows appear in the sky because of children like you and me. One day, colours looked down from above and liked what they could see."
P10	"They saw children with light skin, dark skin and everything in between. They thought, 'How wonderful it must be to be as beautiful as these.'"
P11	"They came together in the sky and spoke about what they could do. @@They decided, 'If we are to be beautiful we must do it as a group.'"
P12	"Now they join together and shine as brightly as they can. Hoping to be as beautiful as the children they see, just like you and me."
