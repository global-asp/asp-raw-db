P4	Your adapted text@  Nandini eagerly watched everything that Gingile@  was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a@  thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Nandini@  flittered from branch to branch, closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree. Nandini perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his@  reward.
P5	Your adapted text@  But, Gingile put out@  the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home, ignoring the bird. Nandini called out angrily, "VIC-torr!@  VIC-torrr!" Gingile@  stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. "You want some@  honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work, and got all the stings.@  Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?" Then he walked@  off. Nandini was furious! This was no way to treat@  him! But he would get his revenge.

P7	Your adapted text@  One day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of the Nandini. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly@  followed the bird once again. After leading Gingile@  along the edge of the forest, Nandini stopped to@  rest in a great umbrella thorn. "Ahh,"@  thought Gingile. "The hive must be in this@  tree." He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking@  branch in his teeth. Nandini sat and watched.

P11	Your adapted text@  Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed@  a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He@  hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too@  sleepy to chase him. Nandini, the Honeyguide, had@  his revenge. And Gingile learned his lesson.
P12	Your adapted text@  And so, when the children of Gingile hear the story of Nandini@  they have respect for the little bird. Whenever they harvest honey, they make@  sure to leave the biggest part of the comb for Honeyguide!
