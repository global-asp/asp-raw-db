P1	Once upon a time in a very small and remote village. There lived an hunter who is fearless and very fortified. He has seven wives and twenty-five children, all male children except for the last born who happens to be a girl. In those days,
P2	Male children are regarded as heirs of the family regardless of what family background it may be. But in the case of this hunter who already had so many male children, a female child indeed is a great blessing from the god's.
P3	So Hunter loved his daughter exceedingly that he hardly Miss her presence except for when he's on the hunting ground. But the moment he get back from hunting her daughter is his best friend after food.
P4	He believes his daughter is the reincarnation of his late mother. So he will always call her by his mother's name "ABEBI" Meaning A plead to birth. Which makes her blush a lot. Abebi' is very beautiful and charming, she loves her siblings.
P5	But most of them feel jealous of how much she's been loved by their father.@So one day, The hunter is out hunting, Asabi's other siblings decide to make a ruthless plan against their sister, with the motives that if she's out of the way,
P6	They could regain the love of their father. So they lured Abebi' to the evil forest where it was forbidden for any human to go. Abebi' been an innocent and naive little damsel just followed his siblings without asking too many questions.
P7	Follow behind his siblings until the get to the edge of the forest. They took a pulse, looked at one another and laugh...@They told Abebi' to wait there that they needed to get something. And so they left her there and returned home.
P8	It was getting dark and nobody is coming forth, so she began to get scared due to the horrible sound of the forest. She remembered her father's words to always take shelter on the tree where she could see what's coming, so she did.
P9	Just when she began to climb up a voice called to her, it was a very harmonious voice. And very beautiful to the ear.so she looked down to take a glance of who it was. Behold a beautiful lady from nowhere, she must be Angel so she thought.
P10	Indeed she is, the beautiful lady urge her to come down so she did. The lady then ask what she is doing in the forbidden forest alone. She told her with a teary eyes how her siblings abandoned her.
P11	Meanwhile at home, the hunter just returned home without sensing the presence of his daughter began to ask curiously but no one would give any tangible answer.
P12	So he was worried. Meanwhile Abebi' found solace with the beautiful lady who generously escorted her back to the village with stories of beautiful adventures. That's makes Abebi'laugh and blush.
P13	So they got to the village where Abebi'came from. With smile on her face she pointed to her father's hut. And thanked the lady and just as she wanted to say another words the lady disappear. now she became fearful and ran home.
P14	When her father saw her he became very delightful and happy.. he asked what happened and so she narrated her ordeals. The hunter punished the rest of the siblings and warn them against doing anything to hurt their sister.
P15	And he also promised to love them all with equality. And so they all lived happily ever after.@@The End.
