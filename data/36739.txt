desc:	The Symphs caused chaos in the classroom.

page_text:

P1	It was a nice morning in Springville and it was time for school. My teacher Mrs Holly said, "good morning everybody, how are you doing today?"
P2	We all said, "we are doing well, how about you Mrs Holly?" She responded "I'm fine thank you... now class I'm going to a meeting with the other teachers. So I will be back in one hour, Mrs Lover will look after all of you".
P3	Everyone likes Mrs Lover. @@She walked into the classroom and said, "children please behave. If you all behave we will have a pizza party". Everyone was excited. Sarah asked if we could read on the book wall. "Sure why not", said Mrs Lover.
P4	While Mrs Lover was reading, my friends and I started reading as well. I love reading, I have been reading since I was four years old. A moment later, Ms Lover left the classroom to answer an important phone call.
P5	While I was reading, something weird happened. Funny creatures jumped out of my book. They called themselves the Symphs. The first was called Symph One and the second Symph Two. @@They were hyper-active, silly and very playful.
P6	The Symphs had colorful hair, funny outfits and cute hands. They started running around the classroom like crazy baboons!@@Symph One was ruining Mrs Holly's desk and Symph Two was writing on the white board.
P7	Sarah said "we have to catch these Symphs before Mrs Holly and and Lover come back. Sunny asked "but why are they running so fast?" Danny said, "we can trap them with some yummy snacks". I asked "where can we find yummy snacks?"
P8	Liv suggested that we go ask her brother Ben because he always has snacks in his bag. Sarah said, "Liv and I will go ask him". @@"Bye guys" said Danny as Liv and Sarah went to find Ben.
P9	"Hey what's up Liv?" asked Ben. Liv responded "hey Ben do you have any yummy snacks?" Ben said "yes here you go, but why do you need snacks?" Sarah said "trust me, you don't want to know". They thanked Ben for the snacks and rushed back.
P10	When they got back to the classroom, they found the Symphs fast asleep. @@A few minutes later, they were wide awake and were feeling really hungry. Symph one said "what is that yummy smell?" Symph Two responded "I don't know Symph One".
P11	"We have some yummy cupcakes and other snacks!" said Danny. Symph One and Symph two politely asked "may we please have some? We are feeling really hungry".
P12	Sunny was happy to hear that and said, "if you clean the whole classroom, you can eat as many cupcakes and you like". The Symphs quickly cleaned up the messy classroom and ate the all the cupcakes and snacks.
P13	Shortly afterwards, the Symphs apologised for creating such a big mess. We said "it's ok, next time ask for permission". Sunny said "bye Symph One and Sumph Two travel safely". The Symphs then disappeared back into my book.
P14	Liv, Sunny and Sarah were so relieved that when Ms Lover came back the classroom was spotless as if the Symphs were never there. Ms Lover was so happy and we had a fun pizza party.
P15	Moral of the story: Always ask for permission.
