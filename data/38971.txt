P1	In a battle, a soldier prepared to bring his wounded friend back from the field. @@ His captain said, "Its of no use! Your friend must be dead by now."@@ But the soldier still went on to bring back his friend.
P2	Seeing the dead body, the Captain said, "I told you it was no use. He is dead." @@The soldier replied with moist eyes, "No sir, it was really worth all my efforts. He is my friend."@@ When his friend saw him, he smiled and said his last words, "I knew you would come for me."@@ True friends are precious and rare.
