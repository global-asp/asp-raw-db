page_text:

P1	Pig went out for a short walk. He met Goat,  his best friend.
P2	Goat said,  "Ehe,  Pig! Come with me to my house. We are having a small party."
P3	When they were eating,  Pig thought,  "This food is so delicious. I think I will stay here forever."
P4	It was time for everybody to dance. But Pig danced alone on the side.
P5	At the end of the dance,  they left. After a short while,  Pig said,  "I feel sick."
P6	The others decided to carry Pig to his home.
P7	But Pig cried and said,  "Take me back to Goat's house instead. My home is too far."
P8	They put him down and said,  "You are heavy. You can walk back if you want."
P9	Pig called to two of his friends,  but they ran away without looking at him.
P10	Pig walked back to Goat's house. He thought,  "I just want to eat the delicious food that Goat prepares."
P11	Goat was surprised to see Pig so soon. He asked,  "Did you forget something?" Pig said,  "My friend,  I am sick."
P12	At that time,  the others arrived and began quarrelling Pig. "You are lying. If you were sick,  you would not have walked back here on your own."
P13	Goat knew that Pig was just pretending. Goat was so angry and said, "Go home,  Pig."
P14	Pig turned and skipped away. "At least I tried," he said.
P15	The others said,  "We should never invite Pig to our houses again." They started to celebrate again!
