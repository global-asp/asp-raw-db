page_text:

P1	You are a weak insect that can be blown by the moving wind You suck our blood,  transmitting malaria parasites into our blood streams Making our bodies painful and weak Killing us everywhere in hospitals and homes You weak thing,  leave us alone! Why don't you suck juice from plants as other insects do You have frustrated the government's efforts You attack us during our study times before we go to bed.
