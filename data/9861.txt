page_text:

P1	My name is Erecho Jonathan.I like reading story books because they help us know more about English to speak and write. I like every meal but my best meal is called potato flat breads. Whenever I come back from school,  I immediately go to the refrigerator to get my potato flat breads. When I do not find them there,  I run to my mother in the shopprite because that is where she works from as a cashier,  I request her to go and pick for me potato flat breads because I like them so much.I go to Naguru Parents School in a district called Kampala where my aunt called Tracy stays. I like her daughters called; Pihu,  Phiona,  Prescius,  Pretty. Pihu is in senior six. I am finishing my studies this year and I want to be a doctor by profession and build my own hospital.
