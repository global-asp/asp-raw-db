page_text:

P1	My name is Kobole.   I live in a small village.
P2	I was out picking fruits when I saw something I had never seen before.
P3	There were colourful lines in the sky.
P4	I dropped all the fruit and ran to tell people at home.
P5	People were standing outside surprised.
P6	I said happily,  "It is a beautiful sheet hanging from the sky." "No! I think someone is pouring paint from the sky." Neno said.
P7	Some people agreed with me. Others thought Neno was right. We began to argue.
P8	A man from a faraway village said,  "You are all wrong."
P9	We shouted,  "Tell us what it is if we are wrong."
P10	The stranger said,  "It is the rainbow. Have you never seen the rainbow before?"
P11	We asked the stranger,  "What is a r-a-i-n-b-o-w?"
P12	Neno asked,  "Is it ours? Can we keep it here?" We never got answers to our questions because the man had left.
