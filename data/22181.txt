They even started living together.

On their way they were chatting and laughing.

Hyena was drinking upstream.
P6	Suddenly the hyena stopped drinking.

He complained, "Donkey why you are stirring up the water?"
P7	Donkey kept silent and continued to drink.
P8	Hyena was very angry. 

"Don't you listen? I'm talking to you, Donkey," shouted the hyena.
P9	The donkey looked at the hyena and asked, "Since when did water move from downstream to upstream?"
P10	The hyena replied, "Water started to flow upstream when we become friends." 

The hyena had decided to eat the donkey.
P11	Helplessly, the donkey said, "It is my fault for thinking we could be friends. Alright, eat me then."
P12	Hyena jumped up and grabbed the donkey.
