page_text:

P1	The water in Mulunguzi River starts its journey from the top of Zomba Mountain.@The water giggles as it hits big rocks on its way down.
P2	The water suddenly drops at William Falls.@The splashes form small rainbows.
P3	After the fall, the water assembles at Mulunguzi Dam.@It is the waterâ€™s resting point.@It is a beautiful dam.
P4	From the dam the water passes through Zomba Botanical Garden.@A thick shed of tall trees cools the water. The monkeys drink here.
P5	It is now in the city.@Passing under bridges.
P6	The water stops briefly at Nkada dam.@Here children swim. The water is not clean anymore.
P7	The water goes further down to Lake Chirwa.
P8	Lake Chirwa has no outlet.@The water can only evaporate into the sky.
