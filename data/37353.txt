desc:	Once there were a group of very smart kids in their school who worked very hard

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was 5 best friends who loved doing their homework together after school
P2	The other kids at school called them bookworms because they were always busy with school work.
P3	One day one while they were busy one of the naughty kids came and stole all of their pencils so they couldn't do their homework.
P4	The kids were upset but they didn't let it get them down, they had other pencils in one of the friends bag. They were smart enough to hide some of the pencils so that nobody can get it.
