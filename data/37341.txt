page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, in a small village, lived two boys with their Father.
P2	One day the boys took their picnic basket, filled with delicious food, and walk to the river.
P3	Suddenly, a big monkey jumped out of the bush before them. The boys were very scared.
P4	The monkey took the picnic basket from the boys and are everything. The boys stood there, crying.
P5	After the monkey finished the food and ran off, the boys ran back to their Father and told him what happened. @The Father was very angry. He said, "I will teach that monkey a lesson he will never forget!"
P6	The next day, the Father put their dog into the picnic basket, covered him with a cloth and told the boys to take a walk to the river again. @And as expected, the monkey again jumped out before them.
P7	Thinking that it is delicious food, the monkey tried to grab the basket.
P8	To his surprise, the dog jumped out and chased him away. @The monkey never tried to grab food from anyone again.
P9	When they got home, the boys told their Father what happened. They had a good laugh about it.
