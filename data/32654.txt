page_text:

P1	There lived a green frog called Bunato who had no food. He was sad and very hungry, he really needed to eat.
P2	Bunato dreamed of eating the food he normally saw the humans eat but he did not know any human that would give him some food.
P3	He went out to get some food for himself but it was raining heavily. He lost all hope because he knew he  would not meet any human in the rain.
P4	On his way, he met Usha the snake and asked him if he had some food to share with him but Usha had eaten his last meal, there was none to share.
P5	Siko had no food. Bunana the monkey arrived while they spoke, they talked about where to get some food for Bunato.
P6	Even Bunana had no food so Bunato decided to ask everyone for help. They could have helped but Bunato only wanted to eat bread, corn and pineapple.
P7	Siko the snake decided to check with his friend Mr Busco the human for these food items on Bunato's behalf.
P8	Siko was fortunate, his friend Mr Busco had some bread, pineapple and corn in his home so he gave him some to take to his friend Bunato.
