desc:	Water takes many forms over the course of the water cycle. This story imagines riding on drops of water starting as rain

page_text:

P1	Rain is falling from the sky. Water is running everywhere@@The earth is happy, and the children are happy.@@Everyone is happy because drops of water are falling from the clouds.
P2	Clouds are made from water that is in the form of gas, called water vapour.@@Water vapour in the clouds increases until there is enough to create raindrops.@@The children jump on the raindrops to ride them. They will follow the water cycle.
P3	The grass and plants receive the rain joyfully. @@Earthworms are rejoicing. "It has arrived! Rain is here!" they shout excitedly.@@Water brings life. When there is no water, all living things die.
P4	The roots of plants can quench their thirst. @@Tree will grow new buds. The world will look green. @@We will have shade from the trees when the sun is scorching hot.@@Our crops will grow, and our rivers will flow with water.
P5	The raindrops soak deep into the soil.  @@The children travel underground with the water.@@Look at the animals and insects in their burrows.
P6	A water pump draws the water up into a tap.@@We need water to grow food and raise animals. We need water to wash. We need water to live.@@We should use water very carefully. It is a scarce resource.
P7	The drops join together to form streams and rivers, which flow into the ocean.@@The children try to guess how many drops of water there are in the oceans. Do you know?
P8	The hot sun heats the water and it changes from liquid to vapour, also called gas.@@The water vapour rises into the sky, and the children ride along.@@The water drops in water vapour are so tiny that you can't see them without using a microscope.
P9	The children play in the clouds, which are made of water vapour.@@Water vapour collects, forming heavier drops. The water changes from a gas back to liquid.@@The water cycle is nearly complete.
P10	Soon, the children will be able to ride down from the sky.@@The clouds get so full of water drops that they can't hold any more.@@The water falls as rain.
P11	The drops and the children land on the earth.@@The water cycle will continue.@@The water drops will sink into the soil. They will become part of rivers and streams, flowing into the sea.@@And the children will hurry home and put on dry clothes!
P12	Water Cycle@@Water drops fall from the clouds as rain.@@Raindrops fall into rivers and streams, and filter into the ground water. @@Rivers and streams flow into the sea.@@Water rises from the sea as water vapour, forming clouds in the sky.
