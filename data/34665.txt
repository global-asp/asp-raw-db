P1	Long ago, when the pitiless African sun throws it's rays onto the earth, zebra's throat was as dry as a bone.Zebra went to drink water by the river and saw a crocodile!Zebra grasped: "Aah!A crocodile!"Crocodile asked:"Can we be friends?"
P2	"I will never be friends with a crocodile.You will gobble me up!", said Zebra."Please, I'm just a lonely creature.", begged crocodile. Scary zebra rans away.
P3	A few days later, a lion attacked the zebra!Not far from what's happening, crocodile could hear zebra was crying out in pain.. Crocodile rushed to save zebra by pulling and biting lion underneath the water and eventually drowned him.
P4	Shaking zebra thanks crocodile for saving his life."Does that means we can be friends now?"asked crocodile."Yes, just because you are big and scary, doesn't meant we can't be friends."@Moral of the story: Appearances can be deceiving.
