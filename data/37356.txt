P2	Today Mr. Thumi tells Ava to try a tomato, but she does not believe that tomatoes are fruit. Feisty Ava yells: "I will need to do research. I will only try a tomato once I am sure that it is a fruit !" Her mind begins to wonder...
P3	Ava's mom told her that a tomato is a fruit because it has seeds. Her mom then began to sing: "Tomatoes are fruit, they have a bunch of seeds, and they form from flowers."
P4	"Dad, why does everybody believe that tomatoes are fruit ?" Her dad explained that just like an apple grows from the flower so does a tomato. He join Ava's mom: "Tomatoes are fruit, they have a bunch of seeds, and they form from flowers."
P5	The next day, while her teacher was writing on the board, feisty girl jumps up and asks: "Teacher, are tomatoes fruit ?" Her teacher replies: " Yes they are, they grow from a flower and they have seeds."
P6	Little Ava rushed to Mr. Thumi's market after school. She bites into a juicy tomato and sings: "Tomatoes are fruit, they have a bunch of seeds, and they form from flowers." Feisty Ava can finally rest knowing the truth about tomatoes.
