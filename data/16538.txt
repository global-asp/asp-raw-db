desc:	How does a little girl help her parents to recover their older daughter and to know who had wronged them?

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a family which lived in a village called Emarti. In this family were two daughters. The younger girl,  called Tito Kiti,  was her father's favourite child.
P2	One day Tito went to speak to her father. "Fetch milk for the child,  she is thirsty," he said to her mother.
P3	Tito Kiti started telling her father what her elder sister had done. She said,  "Naipei ran away with a moran (Maasai warrior) to the nearby caves."
P4	Meanwhile,  in the cave,  Naipei noticed that the moran was getting bigger and fatter by the day. She decided to find out what he was eating.
P5	The moran did not want to answer her question. So Naipei sang a song asking what he had been eating.  She sang,  "Lomurrani ele kainyooshi iyie inko. Pee itabainji,  nibayu anaa osirua lenkop nalio?"
P6	The moran sang his response to Naipei. He sang,  "Olkiteng' le minyi apa atama. Pee atabainji anaa osirua lenkop nalio." Naipei now knew the truth. The moran had stolen a bull. He was eating the meat!
P7	He was the one who took Naipei's father's bull!
P8	Back at home,  Naipei's family was worried and upset. They had lost one of their biggest bulls. And their daughter had run away from home.
P9	Tito Kiti said to her parents,  "I will help so that Naipei can return home. I will send my friend." The parents looked at her and asked,  "Which friend are you talking about?"
P10	Tito Kiti clapped her hands and a small bird flew down from a tree. She sent the bird to tell Naipei that her mother was sick.
P11	The bird flew far,  over many trees,  and landed at the entrance of a large cave. Naipei came out of the cave when she heard the song of the bird. Naipei ran home as soon as she heard the news.
P12	When she arrived,  she told her parents who had taken their bull. The father thanked his eldest daughter,  and decided to look for the moran who stole from him.
