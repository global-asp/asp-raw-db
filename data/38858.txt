P1	Did I tell you about Bino Bennie the strange new@kid at Think Big Primary School?@@You see Bino Bennie had an incredible gift. He could see and hear things no others could.
P2	Of course, for a ten year old, he had an exceptionally long neck, very large ears and googly eyes behind his BINOCUGLASSES.@@This boy was strange, capital S..T..R..A..N..G..E
P3	One day I was walking down the path at school, when I stopped dead in my tracks. @@They say, "Curiosity kills the cat". No cat in sight, but there was Bino Bennie. He carried no schoolbag or lunch box, he had a tiny blue bug box instead. @@Rumour had it he was a@BUGCHEWMANIAC, but we were oh so wrong.
P4	Bino Bennie had an unusual pet. Milly was pretty dangerous, but for now she could not FLY or SSSSTING.@@If she was deadly, what on earth could she be? Maybe a snake or a spider, let's wait and see.
P5	So here comes the clues  to THE Bino Box Milly.@@"I spy with my little eyeâ€¦@Something with eyes on top of its head and not to forget six skinny legs."@@"I spy something, but it's not a fat fly. It certainly has wings, and can normally fly, buzz and sting."
P6	We thought and we thought and then the teacher just said,@"Bennie, out with the truth. We want to know. Is Milly a mouse, a mongoose or a mini mole?"
P7	Bino Bennie opened his bug box and smiled, he whispered her name and reached deep inside.
P8	All EYES were on Bennie and we reached out to see. Who could believe this tiny little thing was Milly Mosquito without wings or a sting!
