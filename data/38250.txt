page_text:

P1	In a rural area named Foxville, once lived a little girl called Sibo. She stayed with her sick mom and didn't have friends.
P2	The people of Foxville were mean to Sibo because she had an angelic voice. Birds were able to respond her singing.
P3	Sibo loved waking up early and would sing loudly in their backyard together with little birds and her dog barking all round in excitement, she also loved singing for her mom on happy and sad days.
P4	One morning she woke up and sang, but realised that her mom did not come outside to sing with her as always. She went inside and to her saddening surprise her mom had fallen off her bed, she was very sick.
P5	Sibo ran outside crying for help "Mrs Tseko my mom is not well." Mrs Tseko replied "go away little noisemaker!"  Sibo left sobbing in tears.
P6	She ran down across the street and shouted "Mr Sithole please help me mommy is very sick." Her cry fell on deaf ears and he also chased her away.
P7	Sibo went home very sad. On her way back she could hear bird singing to one of her tunes, she looked around but could not see the bird anywhere
P8	She wondered where it could be. As she was approaching the big mango tree the tune became louder and clearer. She stood under the tree.
P9	An angelic voice came from the tree saying "Sibo my princess every little wish you have can come true, don't worry you're not alone."
P10	She was amazed and wondered "who are you mister?" she saw the most beautiful bird flying down and rested its claws on her shoulder. Sibo has never seen such a beautiful bird before it shined of sparkles.
P11	Sibo wiped her tears and smiled. She asked "Why are you tuning to my song?" Birdy said "I am a friend and I can make your worries go away, now pull out one feather from my wing and make a wish."
P12	She gently pulled out a beautiful feather closed her eyes and said "I wish people liked us for we only want to be happy and make beautiful songs." A tear rolled down her cheek.
P13	When she opened her eyes she saw a  beautiful rainbow and sparkles from the wondrous bird. It said go home Sibo all is well.
P14	She ran home in excitement and found her mom singing and dancing happily. Mr Sithole's family were beating drums and Mrs Tseko had her shaker.
P15	Sibo stood by the gate and invited people of Foxville who passed by to join the party and everyone came in to sing and dance.
P16	Sibo joined and started singing with her beautiful voice, she saw Mr wondrous bird and smiled. The birdy flew over and they all sang together. It was a jolly jolly good day.
