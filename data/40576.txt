page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a little boy who saved the whole village from a creature (ekishi nauwandjomba), this was a creature that wanted to own the village and started killing people in the village.
P2	When the little boy realized that it was  getting serious, he decided to save the village by coming up with a brilliant plan to kill the creature.
P3	The boy told the people in the village to get enough food and water, and then he hid everyone in one big house for some time.
P4	After that, he took his spear, an axe, a big bucket of hot charcoal, and fire wood. He then climbed and hid on a big tree.
P5	The creature came again, this time it searched and searched around the village but it coudn't find anyone.
P6	It started singing to express its happiness for finally owning the village, while singing, it heard a small voice coming from the other end  of the village, it was the little boy singing too.
P7	The creature quickly went there to kill the little boy. The little boy was far up on a tree, the creature couldn't reach him, it was standing underneath the tree making scary sounds so that the little boy can fall out from fear.
P8	The little boy was fearless, he threw the spear but the creature swallowed it, he threw the axe but it swallowed it aswell, he threw the hot charcoal and again it swallowed it, and finally he threw the firewood but again it swallowed it.
P9	The creature felt so thirsty after, it decided to go and look for water. There are only a few water pods around the village. It went to the first pod and there was no water, it walked to the next pod and was wondering what had happened ?
P10	It's throat was dry and the stomach was burning. The little boy knew, the hot charcoal and fire wood must be burning him from the inside. He quietly followed behind to see if the creature will die.
P11	The creature was walking very slowly to the next water pod, it was getting weaker by the second. It couldn't reach the next water pod before it collapsed and died.
P12	The little boy was so excited, he went to call everyone and they celebrated. The little boy saved the village.
