page_text:

P1	It was Madaraka Day. Our class went on a trip to Meru National Park. Three teachers went with us. @@In the Park, we saw a lion and an elephant. They were drinking water together.
P2	We also saw a herd of zebras. They were racing towards a pond to drink water too. @@We followed them slowly.
P3	At the pond, we saw many animals together. There was a giraffe. @@Giraffes are very tall animals. @@"They eat leaves from tall trees," said Teacher Muthoni.
P4	After lunch, we saw more animals. We found the oldest elephant in the Park. I discovered she is as old as my grand father! Grandfather is eighty years old. @@It was getting dark, so we thanked the guards and began our journey back to school.
P5	When we arrived, the sun was gradually disappearing behind the mountain. @@That day we reached home very late. We were all very happy with the trip.@@We had fun!.
