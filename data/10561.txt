desc:	River Temu flourished and was a source of life for both people and animals until Matata ruined it. Fortunately

page_text:

P1	Two small streams formed River Temu. The sheep,  goats and deer lived because of River Temu.
P2	When Matata became headman,  he cut down trees. He made a path from the top of the hill to the bottom.
P3	Matata's children and their friends ran all over the place. They broke branches. They lit fires and left them burning.
P4	River Temu stopped flowing. The deer went away. Sheep and goats grew thinner and thinner.
P5	The people chased away Matata,  the headman. They appointed Baraka as the new leader. They were happy again.
P6	The path was closed and grass grew once again. River Temu was revived. The land became greener than ever before.
P7	People sang,  "Long live Baraka,  long live Baraka." "May our children and children's children forever respect River Temu."
