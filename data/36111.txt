page_text:

P1	Have you been to Arawa? There you will find a mountain called Kudu. @@The earth that covers the mountain is called Audu.  @@Kudu and Audu are grandchildren of Ç€Kagarma, who is the Mantis and can transform all things into all things.
P2	Around Kudu's neck is a necklace of tortoises with stones inside. The necklace is tied with the sinew of a baboon. @@That is why there are baboons all over the mountain Kudu. The baboons are always  looking for their brother with whose sinew the necklace was made.
P3	Around Audu's neck is a string of calabashes with seeds that send shoots into her neck and make  growth all around her.@@The necklace is tied with the bark of a tree.
P4	Do you see the fire starting on the mountain? It starts with a tree. @@The tree comes looking for the bark that was taken to tie the calabashes around the neck of Audu.  @@The tree attacks with its roots. It is going to crush Audu and Kudu.
P5	Kagarma the Mantis changes the husband of Audu into a huge fire. @@He changes the daughter of Audu into a haze that flickers above the fire.
P6	The raging fire burns the grass. @@The trees get such a fright that they stumble a few steps back.@@The fire licks at their roots and the smoke blows between their leaves.
P7	The trees are so scared that they all run away in a thundering cloud of dust. @@The cloud soon disappears over the horizon.
P8	Now the trees have left Kudu and Audu.@@For the time being.@@They live together, sleeping above us. I wonder what will happen if they wake up?
