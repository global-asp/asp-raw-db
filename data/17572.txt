page_text:

P1	One day at the river,  Dog came across some eggs in the sand. He asked himself,  "Which animal left these eggs here?"
P2	He counted ten eggs and thought they might belong to Duck. He put them in his bag.
P3	He took the eggs home and put them in a warm place.
P4	When Dog returned to the river,  he met Crocodile. She asked,  "Have you seen my eggs?" "I don't know anything about your eggs," he replied.
P5	Crocodile started visiting all the animals asking about her eggs.
P6	Meanwhile,  the eggs hatched one by one.
P7	Dog did his best to look after the baby crocodiles,  but there was never enough food. The young crocodiles were always hungry.
P8	One day Crocodile went to Dog's house looking for her eggs. As she stood outside,  she heard the rumbling of little crocodile bellies!
P9	Crocodile stormed inside and hit Dog with her tail. Dog yelped and jumped through the window.
P10	Crocodile chased Dog all the way to the river.
P11	Dog cried,  "I'm sorry,  I didn't know they were your eggs!"
P12	Crocodile believed him and forgave him. She took her offspring for their first swimming lesson.
