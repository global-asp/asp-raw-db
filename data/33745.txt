page_text:

P1	You have never met such a clever dog as Heidi. @@She thinks that she is a human.
P2	When I brush my teeth, she also wants me to brush her teeth.
P3	When I am watching television, she moves her eyes. @@It is as if she understands everything on the screen.
P4	One night, we were watching a soccer match.@ @There was a knock on the door. @@It was my friend, Mmapula.
P5	It was good to see her. We greeted each other in excitement.@@But, Mmapula didn't greet Heidi. @@I forgot to introduce them!
P6	Heidi was used to being greeted by someone shaking her paw.@@She was very annoyed.@@We went to sit. But before I could offer Mmapula a chair, she sat down on Heidi's chair!
P7	The dog could not take this nonsense. But she did not give me a chance to speak. @@In a blink of an eye, Heidi had jumped on Mmapula's lap. @@She barked at Mmapula, staring her in the eyes.
P8	Heidi was fierce! Mmapula was in a dilemma.@@I acted quickly, and removed Heidi from her lap.@@But from that day, Mmapula never again set foot in my house.
