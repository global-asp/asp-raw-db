page_text:

P1	One hot summer day, Khosi was pacing to and fro, wondering what to do. Her mother had gone to the fields, leaving Khosi behind.@@An idea flashed into Khosi's head like a flashlight. "The river! I'll go swimming. But I can't go alone. Who will go with me?"
P2	At that moment, Mama Sophie passed on her way to the river. She was carrying a big basin full of clothes.@@"Aha! I'll follow Mama Sophie to the river," said Khosi to herself. As they walked together, Khosi's friend Nozipho joined them.
P3	At the river, Khosi said to Nozipho, "I am finished with swimming in the shallow waters! I am going to show everyone that I, Khosi, can swim in deep waters!"@@Khosi plunged into the water and began swimming. Nozipho, who never liked swimming, watched from the river bank.
P4	As Nozipho was watching her friend, she noticed that something changed. Something was different about Khosi's swimming.@@Nozipho was frightened by what she saw. She called out to Mama Sophie who was washing nearby. "Help, Khosi is drowning!" yelled Nozipho.
P5	In a split second, Mama Sophie jumped into the water, then dived where Khosi went under. @@She saw Khosi sinking and grabbed her arm, coming back up with her.@@Mama Sophie swam with Khosi, and carried her out of the river. Khosi was struggling to breathe.
P6	Without pausing, Mama Sophie carried Khosi on her back to the village clinic.@@At the clinic, a nurse hurried to help. "She is lucky that she was not under water any longer!" said the nurse.@@Mama Sophie sighed a sigh of relief. Everyone at the clinic congratulated her.
P7	News of Mama Sophie's courage and quick-thinking reached the chief's kraal. He sent a messenger to call her.@@Mama Sophie explained how she became a good swimmer.  "As a girl, the water was part of my life. The river was where we drank, washed, played and fished."
P8	The chief called a meeting of everyone in the village. He announced his decision to reward Mama Sophie. @@Women ululated, men whistled, and children cheered in excitement.@@The children danced around Mama Sophie, singing, "Nothing can touch me, ukhona umama ka sibindi gidi!"
