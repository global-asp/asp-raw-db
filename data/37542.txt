page_text:

P1	Tagbilaran as a settlement is known to have dated back as early as the 15th Century known as the “Bool Kingdom”.
P2	Tagbilaran started as a small settlement of natives who swore by the spirit of the Anito, a pagan god, in the vicinity of lower Mansasa.
P3	They were simple in their ways and peaceful, husky in build and generally tall.
P4	During the later years of the Spanish era, a more advanced and civilized community was established at Sitio Ubos, the lower coastal portion at the back of the present Cathedral compound.
P5	Most of their houses were made of local materials like bamboo, molave and nipa, except for a few which were made of limestones and bricks.
