P1	Me and mum are reading a book about rainbows I hope I see one, one day if I see one I will be so excited
P2	It started raining hard for hours and the sun was out. After the rain I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes there was a rainbow I jumped in joy.Then I said look mummy look mummy there is a rainbow!
P3	We sat infront of the book looking at the rainbow. I was so exited to go to the park so I can see the rainbow better .
P4	When we got to the park we sat down on the bench closer to the rainbow.
P5	A few moments later there were five people looking at the rainbow like they knew that there will be a rainbow.
P6	They looked at the rainbow like they have never seen one in a long time. But I hade so much fun.@@Hope you liked this story
