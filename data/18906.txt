page_text:

P1	There was a huge baboon with a large troop of baboons that followed him. He was a real dictator!
P2	But there were many huge baboons in the troop,  and the herd was often not sure which one was giving the orders.
P3	So the other baboons said to the chief,  "You need a special mark,  so that we can be sure who you are. Then we'll be able to follow your orders."
P4	"All right," said the chief. "I'll wear a band round my head. But if I do that you must make sure that you follow my instructions exactly." They all agreed.
P5	So a big baboon tied a head band round the chief's head. The chief said,  "From today,  whatever I tell you to do you must do. I don't want any disobedience."
P6	When the chief jumped the others jumped,  when he sat down the others sat down. When he screamed,  the others would scream.
P7	As time went by the head band became tighter and tighter.
P8	One day the chief sat down and said,  "This head band is hurting me." And he put his head in his hands.
P9	And all the baboons sat down,  and they put their heads in their hands,  and they said,  "This head band is hurting me."
P10	He said,  "No,  I'm serious." And they all said,  "No,  I'm serious." The chief said,  "This thing's killing me." And they all said,  "This thing's killing me."
P11	And then he fell off the rock. And they all imitated him and fell off the rock. Then he began struggling and they began struggling.
P12	Although the rest of the troop survived,  the chief died from his injuries.
