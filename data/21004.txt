page_text:

P1	Fana and her family live in Debre Birhan, a busy town in Ethiopia. Fana is a Grade 3 student. She is good-hearted and wise.
P2	Fana loves animals. She has a cat, two hens, a goat and a dove. She spends time with these animals, feeding them, and playing with them.
P3	One day, Fana was playing in the school yard with her friends when she saw children throwing stones at doves. 

"Why are they hurting the doves?" She asked herself.
P4	She stopped playing and ran towards the children throwing stones. 

At first her friends didn't understand what was happening, then they followed her. "Stop throwing stones," shouted Fana.
P5	The other children ran away. 

Fana caught the two injured doves. She saw wounds on their wings. She decided to take the two doves home to look after them.
P6	She fed the doves. In the evening she told her family what she saw and did during the day, and how she saved the doves.
P7	In the morning Fana and her parents went to the clinic and got medicine for the doves. 

After a few days, the doves' wounds healed. Fana felt very happy.
P8	Fana always tells her friends, "I love animals. Animals are useful to us and they are our friends. We must protect and preserve them."
