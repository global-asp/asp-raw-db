P3	Honey badger @Honey badger @He's cooking up a storm.@He takes a ladle to stir the volcano@while he sings this song: @"Bees bees bring me bees.@They'll make me gold to eat.@Black and yellow, black and yellow.@They'll make me gold so sweet."
P4	Kaboom! Swoosh!@Goes the volcano @erupting with swarms of beesâ€¦ @They'll make honey @for the god of gold @to keep him pleased.

P8	Honey badger @Honey badger @He's jumping up and down. @"HA HA @You can't sting me @I'm armoured in my gold!"
