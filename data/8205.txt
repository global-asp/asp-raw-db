page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  Man was walking in the bush. Suddenly,  he met Lion!
P2	Lion was resting in the short grass.
P3	The meeting was so sudden that Man did not know what to do. He was full of fear.
P4	At first,  Lion was surprised too,  and a little afraid. But there was a low rumble in his stomach,  because he was hungry.
P5	Man suddenly found himself up a tall tree. He began to shout at Lion.
P6	Lion lay down under the tree,  waiting for his meal. As time went on,  Lion fell asleep,  or so it seemed.
P7	Soon Man fell asleep. Then he woke up again. Finally he dozed off and went fast asleep.
P8	But then he crashed down on the sleeping Lion!
P9	They both woke up confused and frightened. Lion forgot his meal and ran for his life.
P10	Man began to run in the same direction as Lion. Then he realized that he was running behind Lion!
P11	So he changed direction and escaped. He was not eaten by Lion!
