P1	One morning, mummy was busy preparing breakfast for everyone. Saeed was sitting eating his green beans, on the kitchen table. Suddenly, Jana came in and said in a sleepy voice,@”Good morning, can I have pancakes for breakfast mum, please?”.
P2	“Good morning Jana, sure dear” Mum answered.@Saeed yelled in excitement, “I also want pancakes, I love pancakes! I love pancakes!”.@“Stop copying me!” Jana commented.@“Here are pancakes with strawberry jam for my beloved ones” Mum said.
P3	After the family had their breakfast, the children rushed to play in the garden. Saeed was riding his bicycle around, until Jana grabbed a ball to bounce. He started tackling the ball to play with her. But Jana stopped him and said: I took
P4	the ball first!”. Saeed answered “but I want to play with our ball too!”. @Here Jana yelled “Why do you always copy me?”.
P5	Suddenly daddy passed by, in his car and pressed on the horn “beep, beep!” calling his kids to come. “Do you guys have free time, for a shopping trip?” Dad asked, and continued “I want to buy you new skatings, as the weather is lovely this
P6	season, and I want to see you rolling around”. @The kids shouted super excited “ Horraaay!" ….@ "Of course, we have time daddy". Jana added.
P7	When they arrived to the shop, Jana spotted in-line-skating shoes pair. She asked the shop keeper to bring her size from that pair. Saeed was too excited that he also asked the shopkeeper for the same pair of skating.
P8	But unluckily, the shopkeeper told him that they don’t have his size from the same pair of skating. That made Saeed start to cry. Daddy came and asked Saeed “Why don’t you try the four-roller-skating?”
P9	“Because I Love the In-Line –Skating more.” Saeed answered sadly. Here Jana said with frustration “No! that’s not true. He hasn't even tried any kind of skating shoes. He is just copying me. And I started to hate it! Can you please stop
P10	copying me?”. Dad had confusion on his face, his hands rubbing his chin, and thinking… He decided to leave the shop and go back home at the mean time.
P11	At home, Jana passed by daddy, but he was busy using his fixing tools to make or fix something. So, she went back to her room. Just when she opened her fidget's drawer, a screw was loosened and so the drawer fell down on the floor. And yes,
P12	she remembered daddy’s fixing tools. She went back to him and asked if she can borrow them. Daddy was happy and asked her “How did you know that you need the fixing tools to fix your drawer?” she answered,” because I saw you using them for
P13	fixing”. @“So, are you copying me?” asked dad. “Jana went like “Ahhhh, mmmm, yyyes!?”@ Dad: “Don’t be shy to admit it” @Jana: “I’m just learning from you!”@ Dad: "And so your brother, that’s how the small ones learn, watching and copying
P14	the beloved elder ones, and we have to be patient with them and encourage them”. "And here is a surprise,” dad continued, “I made two One-line-skating pairs for you and your brother.” Dad explained.
P15	The kids jumped with happiness and said: “Thank you daddy we love you and mummy”. “You guys can go now and enjoy playing with your new skating shoes, while I fix Jana’s drawer”, Dad said happily.
