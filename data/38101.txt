page_text:

P1	A long time ago, in Kuruman, in a village called Gasehubane, there lived a poor family of three. @@It was Taolo, his mother, and his father.
P2	Taolo's father was worried. His family was hungry and they had nothing to eat. He took his spear and went hunting. @@He was hoping and praying to catch an animal to bring home.
P3	Once in the forest, Taolo's father began to walk slowly. @@He saw a giraffe tied to a big tree.
P4	He thought to himself, "If I take the giraffe, my family will have something to eat tonight."@@He said, "Giraffe, can you help me pick fruits up in the trees? In turn, I will set you free."
P5	The giraffe agreed.@@Taolo's father cut the green rope that tied the giraffe to the tree.
P6	"How do I know you won't kill me?" asked the giraffe nervously, as it leapt up.@@The giraffe's hooves pushed hard against Taolo's father, and he fell down.
P7	Taolo's father ran towards the giraffe and jumped to catch its tail. @@It was too late, the giraffe slipped away.
P8	Taolo's father went home disappointed and sad. His family was going to sleep hungry again. @@He did not know what to do. @@He said to himself, "I will try again tomorrow."
