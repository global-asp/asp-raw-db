desc:	The second term school trip is on. But very expensive for most students to afford. Mum paid for me and I enjoyed it. But Mum was not happy. Why was she so angry?

page_text:

P1	It was a second term when our school organised a trip. They charged a large sum of money and most of the students could not afford it. 
 The waited day reached when the trip had been organised but very little children had paid. On the previous trips, we used to go with almost five buses but this time it was only one coaster. 
When I heard them reading those who paid for the trip, I also got closer and they read like eighteen student.
P2	When I heard them reading those who paid for the trip, I also got closer and they read like eighteen student. When the nineteenth came, she was absent but I said, "let me go in this one's place when they do not know". Then I entered the bus, sorry the coaster. During that time I was in boarding in primary seven.
P3	When we reached the place, it was *Freedom City* and I was so much excited because it was my first time. Our teachers gave  each one of us two bottles of soda and delicious cakes. We ate and enjoyed so much. At that time, it was approaching 1:00 pm and we again went into the coaster and traveled to the beach and it was *Aero Beach*and it was also my first time to go to the beach and I was more excited.
P4	Surprisingly,I had not carried the swimming costume and I swam while wearing the uniform! 
The time for going back to school reached. Remember I was wet. And when the coaster was traveling, it was blowing too much air and unfortunately, I sat nearer to the window. That is when I realised that life can be hard sometimes. I felt like dying because others were in sweaters and dry uniforms yet I had just swum while wearing the uniform.
P5	As time went by, we reached a power station and the car was stopped. So I got time to go to washrooms, removed my uniform and squeezed it until it was dry. It was approaching 9:00 pm and we entered the coaster again for the journey. Oh I enjoyed and even fell asleep though other pupils were shouting and one could not enjoy her sleep. Nothing to do, I just woke up and started shouting too. We shouted so much that people wondered who we were.
P6	At exactly 10:30 pm, we had reached the *Northern Bypass* and almost everyone was tired of shouting. All of us got asleep and that is when the driver got some breathing space. He drove the coaster at a very high speed because we were late. It was very late and I did not know the time at which we reached Kasubi near our school.
P7	I found my mother at school waiting for me but she was so much angry.She barked at the driver and teachers who were around, "How can you take the children to the tour up to this time?" She was not happy at all. In my heart I said, "Let me not mind. After all I have enjoyed the day".
P8	We went back home and the following day, the conversations in all the classes were about the trip.
