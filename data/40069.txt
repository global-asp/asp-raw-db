page_text:

P1	In kansiu village down river Kome around the ridges of Yakima there lived a family in the outskirts of the city ,the land was lifeless full of bushes and stones.There lived  a family of Mr Kiama and his son Matanya.it was a humble family.
P2	Matanya was just  4  years old ,he had not even started schooling the only thing he had is parental education and being raised by his father was a challenge.His father died after being ill forcing Matanya and siblings to become orphans.
P3	The young Matanya did not know what to do or how to take care of his younger siblings.They went for days without food or  bath.They cried but no one was there to help not even their neighbors.Matanya decided to go out in search of food.
P4	Matanya walk for a very long time and got tired.He decided to sit on a sidewalk near a market not knowing that this day was going to turn his life around and mark a new beginning.As Matanya was sitting there hungry ,a boy approached him.
P5	The boy's clothes were tattered and dirty but he had a kind smile on his face.He said to Matanya"Hello there, my name is Mutiso and I live here in the streets with my friend".Mutiso introduced his friends who were very kind.
P6	They welcomed him,when they noticed his silence and all crying around.They helped him with food and offered him a chance to join their street family.He accepted since he had nowhere else to go.Glue and gum became his food .
P7	Matanya wore dirty oily clothes and slept on cartons,he ate from trash bins.His life became miserable compared to when his father was alive.Street life is not glamorous,one had to always be ware of the dangers of harrasment from the police.
P8	In the streets,there was no food and water,no shelter.There were bullys in the streets and sometimes his wounds would take long to heal because he had no medicine to nurse them.Being in the street taught Matanya negative and positive skills
P9	Matanya became a thief and sometimes the market people would beat him not understanding that he was trying to find some food.One day ,he got injured from the beating and the police had to take him to the hospital.
P10	Kind people and volunteers had Matanya's story and visited him in the hospital.Matanya later was sponsored and was taken to school.Together with his siblings they were taken to a children home where they lived a happy life there after.
