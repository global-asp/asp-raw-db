page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a little naughty fish named Walt. He was very cheeky.
P2	Whenever his mother would go to get breakfast,  he would swim away as fast as he could to the open sea.
P3	One day, the sea was not on Walt's side. He was swept away by the high tide. He was swept into a small village and into a little house.
P4	Since the house was not filled with water, Walt eventually died the little boy he was. When his mother got back home, she wondered where Walt was.
P5	Walt's mother looked everywhere until eventually she got to the small village and found her dead son lying on the floor. She cried and cried until the end of time.
