page_text:

P1	Once there was a child who wandered the earth alone. She had no father or mother and was very sad.
P2	Nobody paid attention to her. Her loneliness made her want to cry, but she did not know how to because tears did not exist in the world yet.
P3	When the moon saw the child walking alone, he felt compassion. When the night came, the moon fell to the earth to meet the child.
P4	The moon said, "Let go of your sorrow and cry! But do not let your tears stain the earth. Let your tears fall on me, and I will take them back to the sky."
P5	The orphan child wept the first tears into the world and they fell on the moon. The moon promised to look over her and went back to the sky.
P6	From that day on the child was happy. Everyone in her village loved and protected her. She never cried again.
P7	To this day, the moon holds the stains of the child's tears to remind us of the orphan child's sorrow.
