page_text:

P1	Havilah and Giovanni were eager to arrive at their Aunty's; they had been cooped up in the house since the COVID-19 lockdown in April of 2020. @@They carried their hand sanitizer, put on their face masks and joined Mother in the car.
P2	They drove past a pedestrian bridge; Havilah mentioned to Mother, that it was safer for commuters to use it than running across the road on foot.@@ Giovanni saw a hill in the distance; "what a lovely sight!" He said.
P3	On their way, they saw a mast the children said reminded them of the Eiffel Tower. They drove by a garden and a hoisted Nigerian flag; waving in the air. The children waved at it too.@@Finally, they arrived at Aunty Awuese's house.
P4	They saw a red rose growing in a bag by her fence. They stared at it, mesmerised!@@There were other bags around with stalks sunk, in the sand. Tiny leaves were budding on the stalks. They found out, all the growing plants were a nursery.
P5	They entered the compound and found huge bushes of lemon grass growing in the flower beds.@@They went round, sniffing at the grass Mother said was a herb!
P6	They climbed up the stairs to Aunty Awuese's flat; careful not to touch the railings. The air was fresh and cool, they saw more flowers in earthen and plastic, flower pots.@@This one here is called, hydreangea. Yes, that's its name!
P7	Someone opened the door to the flat. They remembered to greet with their elbow and stepped away, but were immediately drawn to the huge balls hanging from the celling.@@The balls swayed as they went in, a gust of air in their wake.
P8	Havilah and Giovanni were mesmerized. They wondered what the balls were and they asked.@@While they were washing their hands, they listened as Aunty Awuese informed them that the globe-like balls were called,  bamboo lanterns.
P9	She served them, fried Irish potato chips and eggs. Havilah loves Irish potato chips and Giovanni loves fried eggs, but they were too excited to eat.@@Even as they observed social distancing protocols, they itched to return to their story.
P10	And so they returned to the fairytale story they were telling her before the meal.@@They really love spending time with her because she makes them happy, pays attention to their every word and asks them loads of questions.
P11	Aunty showed them her fascinating and strange Christmas tree! The tree had cupcakes and glittering acorns hanging down; they were made out of styrofoam and ribbons!@@Looking at it, they drooled and dreamed of eating yummy cupcakes!
P12	They had fun but it was time to go; Aunty Awuese had a floral delivery to make.@@They were surprised to see some cattle, grazing the grass in the empty plot; downstairs. They stood and watched for a few minutes before entering the car.
P13	They were glad Aunty shared her day with them; even though she couldn't touch them... @@They were sad to go. @@They looked out of the window as the car drove away.
P14	Aunty Awuese is creative, beautiful and kind. She loves flowers and nature.@@ She also loves to share her passion for flowers and beauty with people; that's why she even made it a business. @@She calls it; Floral and Creations.
