P1	This is the beautiful place I call my home.
P2	At home, I watch television.
P3	My friend visits us at home, we play together.
P4	From school, I go back home.
P5	After school, I lie on the bed and take naps at home.
P6	At home, I read peacefully.
P7	At home, I am always welcomed with warm arms after returning from a journey.
P8	Now I am away from you, oh sweet home, my humble abode, how I miss you! There is no place like you.
