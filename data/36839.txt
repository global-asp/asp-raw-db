P1	This is Thato. He is at school in Siyabuswa, South Africa. @@He is the tallest in his class.
P2	Thato is on his way home from school. @@He lives with his family. His home is the farthest place way from his school that he knows. @@He has never been anywhere further.
P3	Thato lives with his older sister and his dad.@@He lives in a friendly neighbourhood.
P4	This is the shack, where Thato and his Gogo live.
P5	Today she does not feel well. Thato feels her temperature by touching her forehead. She feels warmer than usual. She has a fever. She can't buy the groceries, so Thato has to help.
P6	He has to collect all these things:@- 4 eggs@- 2 bags of flour@- 5 herbs@- 3 loaves of bread@- 1 bottle of water
P7	Thato has never bought the groceries before. His Gogo tells him where to get the things:@the water from the dug well, the flour from the farmer, the bread loaves from the shop, the eggs from Junior's Gogo, the herbs from the yard.
P8	Thato is getting nervous. The way to get the groceries is further than his way to school. He looks at the list. He has to make a plan where to go first. He is sorting the list from the lowest to the largest number.
P9	The first stop on his way is to get the water. Thato knows the dug well. At this time of the year the water is very high. He can use the shortest rope to reach the water. Which one is the shortest rope?
P10	Thato pours the water into his bottle. Now he has to get the flour from the farmer. The farmer is the father of his best friend Lethabo.
P11	The farmer welcomes Thato. He is trying to catch the biggest chicken. He asks Thato for help. Which one is the biggest chicken?
P12	Thato is very skilled. He catches the chicken quickly.
P13	The farmer gives him two bags of flour.
P14	Next stop on Thato's journey is the spaza shop. He has to buy the bread loaves there.
P15	In the shop the owner asks him if he want the biggest, the smallest or the average sized bread loaves. Thato looks at them. Which one does he take if he needs the average sized bread?
P16	Now Thato is on his way to Junior's gogo to get the eggs. He looks at the egg boxes, which one does he need? The smaller one or the bigger one?
P17	Thato goes to the yard. He has to collect the herbs. There are alot of herbs and he has to look carefully to cut the right ones.
P18	He needs the smallest herbs. Which herbs are the smallest ones?
P19	Now Thato goes home to the shack. He has to put the groceries into the right bag. He has a big bag and a small bag.
P20	Thato is back home. He shows his Gogo the groceries. She asks him how many things he has bought. So Thato starts to count everything.
P21	1 bottle of water + 2 bags of flour = 3 things.@3 + 3 loaves of bread = 6 things. @6 + 4 eggs = 10 things.@10 + 5 herbs = 15 things.@@In total Thato has bought 15 things.
P22	She is very proud of him. He has bought everything and he never went this far away before. The Gogo begins to feel better again.
