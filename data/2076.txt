desc:	The land is dry and Little Ant is very thirsty. He goes to the river for a drink and is swept away.

page_text:

P1	It was a hot summer day in the dry forest.
P2	Little Ant had no water for many days.
P3	"I need a drop of water,  even if it falls from a leaf," cried Little Ant.
P4	But even the dew had dried up.
P5	"If I do not have water,  I will die," cried Little Ant.    "I must go to the river I heard about."
P6	"The river is full and strong. It will sweep you away," warned a wise squirrel.
P7	But Little Ant was extremely thirsty. "I will die if I don't drink some water." So,  he went to look for the river.
P8	He walked past tufts of grass and over dry branches.
P9	He walked until he heard water splashing. It was the river! He could hear waves.
P10	Little Ant took a long sip of cool water.
P11	He was so happy he did not see a wave coming.
P12	Little Ant tried to grab some grass floating past him. But he was swept away by the water.
P13	"Help me someone. Help me please!" he called.
P14	"Quick,  climb on," said White Dove,  holding a branch in her beak.
P15	"I will stay here until I can thank the dove," decided Little Ant.  "I will wait until she comes back to drink."
P16	One day as he waited,  two boys came to the river. They had their slingshots.
P17	"There is a big white dove that comes here to drink," said one boy. "We will have it for supper tonight."
P18	"I cannot let the boys kill White Dove," thought Little Ant.   "But I am so tiny,  what can I do?"
P19	Just then White Dove flew down from the tree to drink.
P20	Little Ant had an idea.
P21	He jumped onto one boy's foot. Little Ant bit that boy as hard as he could.
P22	The boy jumped. "Ouch!" he shouted.
P23	White Dove was startled and flew away to safety.
P24	That was how Little Ant thanked White Dove for saving him.
