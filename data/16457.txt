page_text:

P1	Mother was finishing packing her clothes in a small bag. Aí sa ko gaas di qgáían dtcobe-coas koe tcana xg'ara.
P2	As she went out the door,  she hugged me and said,  "Bye for now."Eẽs ko nquu-kg'm koe tcg'oa kas ko xgabe te,  a sa a máá: "Qãèse qaù," témé.
P3	"Where are you going,  mum?" I looked up at her as I asked. Ra ghùikg'ai kose tẽe si a máá: "Aíè,  nda sia ko qõò," témé.
P4	I started to cry wanting to follow her but dad lifted me up on his shoulder. Ra kò tshoa-tshoa a kg'ae,  còo si kgoanar hãa khama,  igabagam Papa ba ghùi te,  a quu te.
P5	Dad said,  "Your mother is going to the hospital to have a baby."
P6	When I heard "baby" I stopped crying and looked at him. "Why is she going to get the baby from the hospital?" I asked him.
P7	Dad sat me on a small chair and said,  "I will tell you why she is going to get the baby from the hospital."
P8	I listened keenly to him as he explained although I didn't quite understand why she wasn't having the baby at home. When dad finished explaining,  I asked,  "Will she still love me when she comes back with the other baby?"
P9	My dad held me close and said,  "We will always love you."
P10	"Can I write a letter to her while she is there?" I asked dad.
P11	That evening,  I began to write a letter to mum.
P12	I tore a paper from my exercise book and began to write.
P13	"Mummy,  mummy,  dad said that you have gone to bring another baby."
P14	Please hurry up and return home.
P15	I want you to bring a baby girl,  so I can play with her when she grows up.
P16	You can bring two so one can be mine.
P17	I am waiting for you here outside our house.
P18	I folded my letter so I could give it to my father to bring it to mum. When I woke up the following morning,  the letter was gone.
