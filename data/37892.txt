P3	The boys' name was Michael,@He liked the sea.@His Favorite phrase was,@"I hungee!"
P4	Chelsea and michael looked for fun,@They were as sweet as Honey buns!@They had to be quick and have fun now,@Because this book ends when the sun goes down.
P5	Michael found a ball he played with it some,@But gave it to Chelsea to have more fun!@Chelsea and michael played for an while,@Then continued on their journey through the wild!

P13	At the end of the trail it was night @And it was time for them to say goodnight.@But why was Chelsea sailing at sea??
P14	It was just to get to tee tee!
P15	We hope you enjoyed you two!@Please stay tuned for part 2!
