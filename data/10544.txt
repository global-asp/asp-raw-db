page_text:

P1	Long ago Hen and Eagle were friends. One day,  Eagle found Hen under a tree resting with her hopping bags. Hen was standing on one leg.
P2	Eagle asked Hen,  "Where is your other leg?"
P3	Hen told Eagle,  "The shopkeeper cut off my leg and gave me these groceries in return."
P4	Eagle asked Hen whether he could do the same. He also wanted a bag of groceries. Hen agreed.
P5	Eagle went to the shopkeeper and asked her to cut off one of his legs in exchange for groceries. The shopkeeper accepted.
P6	The eagle hopped on one leg all the way home. But he was happy with the things the shopkeeper gave him.
P7	When Eagle reached home,  he found Hen with both her legs.
P8	Eagle was furious and chased Hen. But he never caught her. Instead,  Eagle always looks out for Hen's children. Whenever he catches one,  he eats it.
