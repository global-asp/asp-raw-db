page_text:

P1	Anansi and Rabbit were friends. 

Anansi was jealous of Rabbit’s farm.
P2	Anansi took over Rabbit’s farm. 

Rabbit was left poor and homeless.
P3	Anansi sold fruits and vegetables. 

He filled a basket with money.
P4	Anansi went home carrying the basket on his head.
P5	Anansi put the basket down and went to shelter from the rain.
P6	It got cold and wet so Anansi hid in a hole.
P7	Vulture covered the basket with his wings.
P8	Vulture told Anansi, “This basket is mine.”
 
Anansi was surprised.
P9	Vulture said, “It is stupid to leave money and
maize unprotected.”
P10	The chief and his elders took time to decide who was right.
P11	Finally, they said, “Vulture is right. You are the thief.” Anansi cried.
P12	Rabbit went back to his farm but Anansi was
poor again.
