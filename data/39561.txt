P1	Children play many plays. 'My Handkerchief' is one of them.
P2	This play has its own rules. First, children stand in cirlces.
P3	Second, they need a handkerchief or a ball to play.
P4	Third, the girl or boy who starts the game hides the ball or handkerchief in her clothes.
P5	Then she runs around the sitting kids saying, "Have you seen my handkerchief?" They respond, "We haven't seen, please."
P6	The girl hides the handkerchief behind one of the children.
P7	She keeps running behind the children without giving a clue where she hid it.
P8	The children in the cirlce check behind them without turning their faces.
P9	The child that got the handkerchief stands up and hits the running girl with it.
P10	If he doesn't hit her, she can run around the cirle once and sit down.
P11	But if the boy hits her with the ball, she sits in the middle.
P12	If he doesn't hit her, he sits in the middle. The game continues like this.
