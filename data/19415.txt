page_text:

P1	Lion,  the most harmful animal was going out for his leisure but unfortunately he fell into a big pit. Looking for help,  he immediately made a loud noise. "Roar,  Roar,  Roar."
P2	When the rest of the animals were moving in a line they heard Mr Lion making noise. They then moved nearer and surrounded the pit. Finding the lion in the pit,  they all laughed,  "Hee-Hee- Woo! We cannot get you out of the pit because you have been cruel to us."
P3	The animals went away leaving lion lonely in the pit. That is why the lion became a malicious animal to other animals and even people. Having been royal to one another can rescue one from danger.
