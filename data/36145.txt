P1	I extremely love to play with slimes, well everyone dose.Wait a minute !! Do you know about the Magical kingdom of slime? fine let me tell you.
P2	Long long ago, in a thick forest my family and I went for a picnic. There my parents were just getting the food all done while I went to delve in the forest, while exploring I went a bit too far.
P3	There I felt like someone was watching me and then in the bushes I went forward to look who is it? What I saw was a cute little fluffy creature which was blue in colour and as soon as I went near ,it started running away from me.
P4	I felt like it's saying"follow me"so I kept following.Nosooner I went through the last bush I saw blue fluffy creatures everywhere."What kind of world it is?" I wondered.Suddenly I saw on the top of castle "The magical kingdom of slime".
P5	Wow! it felt like I am dreaming.Next it lead me to the Slimey Castle. Yonder I saw lot's of slimes in different colours.
P6	Then I suddenly observed that there was a princess who was sad about something. Her face seemed pale and scared. Thus, I thought of helping her.
P7	She divulged "we are Slurpies and we need slime to last, as our slime is going to end till tomorrow noon". I said "it is not a big deal I will surely help you" . She merrily twinkled at me.
P8	The ingredients which I need to make the ideal slime for slurpies:One bottle of Magical crystal glue , food colouring, contact lens solution ( should contain boric acid or sodium borate), baking soda, mixing bowl and a spoon. That's all.
P9	Afterwards I went back to my parents and asked them to purchase all the things which I need to create a slime. They thought about it and then after a while they said "My dear we want to help but we can't provide the Magical crystal glue"
P10	It was almost going to get dark and I had to get it by tomorrow noon or else the whole kingdom is going to parish. I was so frightened and scared.
P11	Suddenly I got a brainstorming idea maybe I could just go to my friend Lousie and ask her for the magical crystal glue because she has the crystal collection.
P12	I went rushing to Louise's house and asked her for magical crystal glue. She first disagreed but after when I told her the whole story, she gave it to me and I straight went to make the slime.
P13	Phew! "My slime is now all set here and now I need to go back to the Magical Kingdom of Slime"I said. It is almost going to get noon I need to hurry. Thereupon I went to the princess.
P14	I instructed her all the ingredients and handovered her the slime which I made. She was so delightful that she gave me a blue box in which there were five different  kinds of slimes. Then I hazily enfolded her and then took the box.
P15	When I went back home I saw that one of the slime could speak and it was the same blue fluffy creature which pointed @me to the mansion.
