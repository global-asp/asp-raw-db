page_text:

P1	Today is my first day of school. I am in Nigeria for the first time. My parents are both Nigerian but move to England before I was born. Now we are coming back and I get to see the land of my ancestors for the first time.
P2	I arrive at school ten minuets before the bell rings. I am given my schedule and hurry to my homeroom. At recces, all of the kids go off and talk with each other and I am left all alone. I sit on a bench and wait until recces is over.
P3	I see my teacher come outside. She sees me sitting alone and calls me over. "What's wrong?" she asks. "No one wants to play with me.' I replied. "Well, the bell is about to ring. Let me take you to the market after school." She says and I agree.
P4	After school, we go to the market and she shows me so many cool things. I find out her name is Ms. Rebecca. She also bought a pretty little basket and I carry it on my arm.
P5	The next day at school a girl comes up and introduces herself as Katie. We talk at recces and I invite her to my house. At home, we take turns putting on fashion shows for my mom and little brother. We become best friends.
P6	That night as Mummy puts me to bed, I think of Katie, and wonder what we could do together some other time. Then I relies that her birthday is coming up and I wanted to do something special for her.
P7	I think for a long time and finally come up with a plan.I will give her the best gift a friend could revive. I jump out of bed and run to tell Mummy what I decided to do.
P8	Next week we went to the market and find some beautiful material that we can make matching dresses out of for Katie and I. I am so excited to show her. This is going to be her best birthday ever. This new school is great.
