P2	There are mountains around the city of Cape Town. @@Trees and plants live on the mountains.
P3	Do you see the fire starting on the mountain? @@It starts with a tree and spreads through the trees.
P4	Once the fire starts it is very difficult to stop, and can spread quickly.
P5	The raging fire burns the grass. @@The fire licks at the tree roots and the smoke blows between their leaves.
