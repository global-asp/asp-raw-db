desc:	He-Goat met Hyena on his way to pilgrimage. Hyena threatened to eat him

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, He-Goat became a believer. 

After staying in the religion for some time, he realised that his beard was now long enough. So he needed to perform pilgrimage to Mecca.
P2	One day, he woke up very early in the morning, gathered all his luggage and began to move toward the East. 

Soon after he left the village that early morning, he found himself face to face with Hyena.
P3	"Hello, Goat!" Hyena said.
"Hello," replied Goat.
"Where are you going this early morning?" asked Hyena.
"I am on my way to pilgrimage," said Goat.
P4	Then, Hyena said, "We have met, so your pilgrimage has been accepted! For it is said, whoever dies on pilgrimage will have all sins forgiven. 

Now I will eat you. Unless you can tell me three truths!"
P5	"I will tell you three truths," answered Goat. 
"I am listening," Hyena said.

Goat said, "First, I wouldn't have gone this way if I knew I would meet you!"
P6	At this point, Hyena burst into laughter and began rolling on the ground. She said, "That is a striking truth!" 

Goat took advantage of this and ran, back towards his village.
P7	Hyena ran after Goat and soon caught up with him.  

"Give me another truth, quickly!" she ordered.
P8	Goat said, "The second truth is, if I go back to the village and tell them that I met you but you didn't eat me, nobody will believe it."
P9	Again, Hyena began to roll on the ground with laughter. She said, "That is truth!" 

For the second time, Goat ran and got closer to the village.
P10	Very soon, Hyena caught up with Goat again.  

"There is still one more truth left unsaid!" Hyena shouted.
P11	Goat said, "The third truth is, if you keep joking around like this, it means that you are not really hungry!"

Hyena laughed until she cried, rolling on the ground. "That is very true!" she giggled.
P12	Goat continued running towards his village.

By the time Hyena caught up, Goat had already reached the village square. That is how He-Goat saved his life.
