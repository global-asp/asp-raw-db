page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there lived a man called Mairu in Bubaali Village. He liked to eat meat so much.
P2	One day,  the chairman of Bubaali village invited all the villagers to his wedding that was to take place at his home.
P3	Then Mairu also heard that there was another wedding in Nabuyanja village. "Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!Two parties on the same day!" Mairu imagined.
P4	"Ha! Ha! Ha! I must attend both parties," he said. "I will first walk to Bubaali then come back to Nabuyanja."
P5	Mairu woke up very early in the morning and walked to Bubaali village. He looked around and saw that the party had not yet started. "I will go back to Nabuyanja and return to Bubaali later," Mairu told himself. "Yes! Yes! I hope I will not be late."
P6	Mairu walked gently back to Bubaali hoping to find the meat, rice, sodas and matooke ready. He was now very hungry. When he arrived,  men and women were still preparing the food.
P7	"I left cooks at Bubaali preparing to cook," he thought. "The food must be ready now." Mairu decided to walk back to Nabuyanja under hot sunshine,  i will not loose hope he added!
P8	Mairu arrived at the Bubaali party,  people had already eaten and cleaned the utensils. Guests were giving presents to the bride and the groom. Mairu was very disappointed. He looked displaced and every one became concerned. But his target was to eat enough.
P9	 He decided to walk back to Nabuyanja village. Because he was hungry and tired,  he could not walk fast any more.
P10	When he arrived at Nabuyanja village,  the food was over and it was time for the bride and groom giving a speech.
P11	Upon hearing that there was no food,  Mairu fell and fainted. He had missed meat from both parties. All he got was some posho and beans on a small plate yet his target was to eat meat.
P12	Gently, he walked back home cursing never to serve two masters at ago.
