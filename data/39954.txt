P1	Milcah lived in a village called Zoom. Zoom was a beautiful village with many exciting things to do. @@Many children roamed around the public play ground on merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings.
P2	The children called her Queen of the ground. This is because she used to chase them away from the play ground. @@Milcah's family were poor.
P3	Milcah longed to go to school but because of financial issues she only did so when she was six years old. @@Until then she used to sit on top of a tree watching children going to school.
P4	It was clear to her that she had to work hard. Milcah never gave up. @@After years of hard work, dedication and staying out of school many times, she finally sat for her final exams.
P5	She succeeded in her  exams. She was happy to get a scholarship for both secondary and University education. @@At the university, she took a course in engineering.
