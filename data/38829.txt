P1	One Sunday morning, the chef in a restaurant put out a basket of fruits to make a fruit salad. @@The fruits started to talk to each other.
P2	The apple said, "I am good for health, the chef will pick me." @@The banana said, "I am yellow and bright, the chef will pick me."
P3	The pear said, "I have a nice shape, the chef will pick me." @@The pineapple said, "I am sweet and juicy, the chef will pick me." @@The pineapple squeezed and squashed the other fruits to be at the top.
P4	The chef heard the fruits talking and said, "What a nice basket of fruits." @@The fruits started shouting, "Pick me, pick only me!"
P5	The chef picked the apple first and put it into a bowl. The apple was happy and laughed at the other fruits. @@The fruits that were left in the basket were shouting, "Pick me, pick me!"
P6	The second fruit that chef picked was the banana. He put it into the bowl. @@The apple and the banana laughed at the other fruits. The fruits that were left in the basket were shouting, "Pick me, pick me!" @@The chef picked the third fruit. It was the pear.
P7	The pineapple was left in the basket and cried, "Pick me, pick me." Finally, the chef picked the pineapple. @@The fruits were amazed because they were all picked for the salad. @@"What a healthy, colourful, body building, nicely shaped, sweet, and juicy fruit salad," smiled the chef.
P8	The fruits were proud and happy. They realised that they are all equally important. @@The fruits started singing, "Pick me, pick me, pick all of us!"@@People in the restaurant loved the song and ordered the fruit salad.
