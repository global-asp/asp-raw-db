page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, Billy-goat lived in a fenced village. The name of the village was Ganhwa.@@Goats then had long and bushy tails, like dogs and wolves.
P2	One day, Billy-goat went to the bush to get honey for his family.@@As he was returning with the honey pot, rain began to fall on him.
P3	Billy-goat ran into a nearby cave to shelter from the rain. As he entered, he saw Hyena!@@Goat was scared, and put down his honey pot, ready to run away.
P4	At the same moment as Hyena moved to attack Billy-goat, Lion ran into the cave!@@Billy-goat was so afraid that his head shook and his body shuddered.@@At once, all the water on his body flew off onto Lion and Hyena.
P5	"Wao!" Lion exclaimed, "How did you do that?"@@"I use this charm called Ganhwa," Billy-goat said, pointing to his testicles.@@"That's nice! Make one for me," Lion demanded.
P6	"We need fresh hyena skin, which must be chewed to become soft," Billy-goat said.@@Hyena tried to escape but Lion was close to the mouth of the cave.
P7	Lion tore off a piece of Hyena's skin and gave it to Billy-goat.@@Billy-goat dipped the skin into the honey pot and offered it to Lion.@@"Chew it, but you must not swallow it," Billy-goat told Lion.
P8	Lion chewed the hyena skin. It was so sweet and delicious that he swallowed the piece of skin.@@So, Lion took another piece of Hyena's skin. Billy-goat dipped it into the honey and gave it to Lion.@@Lion chewed and swallowed the skin each time.
P9	Hyena managed to sneak away while Lion was busy chewing. Most of Hyena's skin was torn off in spots.@@When Lion swallowed and looked up, Hyena was gone.@@Lion ran after Hyena, and Billy-goat also fled.
P10	Lion returned to the cave, but he did not meet Billy-goat.@@Lion pursued and caught up with Billy-goat as he was about to jump the fence into Ganhwa village.
P11	Lion reached out to grab the Ganhwa charm swinging between the legs of Billy-goat.@@He caught only the tail.@@Billy-goat escaped into Ganhwa village, but some of his tail remained in the Lion's claws.
P12	That is why today, goats have short tails and hyenas have spotted skin.
