page_text:

P1	There once lived a leopard in a thick forest everyone loved his leadership but he was geting old and needed an animal to take over ,so he thought "what if I could have a tournament who ever wins get to be the king."
P2	He called everyone to come  for he had a big announcement everyone gathered and he started by saying"I'm getting old and need someone take over  this is how is going to be there will be a spear throwing tournament who ever wins takes over."
P3	He went to the tree and got something everyone had questions to ask he said "this is a spear..."before he could finish he was interrupted, an elephant asked "how do we play?"he said "you throw it , who ever throws the furthest wins.
P4	Animals were so excited especially the elephant the elephant said in excitement " I will be the first to try out "he thought in his mind " if I became king every thing will be perfect."
P5	He threw far but not fur a enough he was disappointed the king said " you've tried but I want further than that "
P6	"Just perfect" he told the wild pig the elephant was furious and disappointed ties started rolling down his chick
P7	The gorilla really threw it further than even the wild pig he was so happy that he threw like that he really had a lot of pride in himself he loughed at elephant "ha! Ha! Ha! I beat you in a game "elephant was ashamed
P8	After a while it was to release the result when gazelle jumped out of the crowd saying "I'll give it a go."
P9	He said again " I'll give it a go but trust me am not perfect that much  then the king said "you'll have a go I know you are perfect."
P10	He threw it far and it hit the ground with the tip everyone proudly cheered loudly  the king was a amazed with him and he said "all the animals threw so well but you your something else"
P11	"I hereby declare gazelle the new king" the king said  some  of the animals were furious others were  happy for him and the king said to himself "ohoohoo retirement " the leopard was so happy .@Moral@Pride comes before failure
