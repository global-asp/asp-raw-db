P1	Once upon a time there was a little pup, who wanted to become a super pup but when ever he told anyone about his dream they just laughed at him, because he was so small , and then one day he heard a loud noise.
P2	Everyone was terrified , and that's when the loud noise came again , and then the pup said never fear when Puppolos is here, everyone cheered save us , save us. And on went  Puppolos through the woods and  he saw the Gruffalo crying.
P3	What's wrong he asked ,"I lost my home"said the Gruffalo. The forest cleaner destroyed my house , help help help Puppolos, never fear said Puppolos when I am near,
P4	CHAPTER 2@HOW DOES THE PUPPOLOS SAVE THE FOREST ?
P5	On went Puppolos through the woods I see the forest destoryer, but why is he not destroying anything like the Gruffalo said?" Puppolos said to himself"@So he went and asked him what was the matter.
P6	The forest cleaner then told the whole truth , and Puppolos,said "that sneaky little Gruffalo destroyed your home but I will stop him from destroying other people's houses just wait and watch I must first go and warn everyone, and so he did
P7	Everyone in the forest had teamed up and caught the naughty Gruffalo and put him in the forest jail until he said that he was sorry, but he never did and that's why the Gruffalo stayed in jail for the rest of his life.
P8	And the town lived happily ever after, well until the next time @THE END
