P1	"Be yourself and don't be afraid to show to the whole world your true color!"
P2	Long time ago, in the Municipality of Basey, Province of Samar there was a simple girl whose named Christine with a tan skin color, curly hair, dark brown eyes and skinny body. She was an achiever in her grade school and high school.
P3	Christine is fun of sleeping until one day...
P4	She was in the other place when she opened her eyes. There were full of chaos and many people protesting because of their rights. There she realized that the world is so unfair.
P5	She pause for a while, thinking how she can deal with it. She immediately question herself, did she portray her true identity? Is she true to herself? "I am myself and I'm proud I am the person I want to be" she replied to herself.
P6	When she hold her senses back she realized  she was in front of the computer.
