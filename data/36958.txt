P1	Wake up @Wake up !  Wake up !@It's a lovely day.@Oh ! Please get up @And come and play.@The birds are singing in the trees, And you can hear the buzzing bees.@@            Wake up ! Wake up !@            It's a lovely day.
P2	Oh n please get up.@And come and play.@It's  much too late to lie on bed.@Ok I am get up.
