P1	Aye went for a walk. On her way she met Bee. Together they walked through the forest.
P2	On their way they met Cat and Cock.@How do you do, said Cat to Cock? I am going to the feast with Aye and Bee. Are you coming?
P3	Hurry, said Cock to Cat. As they walked further towards the feast they met Dog. @Didn't you hear, Dog? We are having a big feast. Are you coming? So Aye, Bee, Cat and Cock went with Dog.
P4	On the way they met Elephant. He raised his trunk and greeted them with a huge... @HELLOOOO@Hello Elephant, we are going to the big feast. Are you coming?@YES, trumpeted Elephant.@So Aye, Bee, Cock, Cat, Dog and Elephant want to the feast.
P5	As the animals and Aye and Bee walked, they met Flora. She was eating her fruits which she carried for lunch.@Will you join us for the feast asked Cat. @Oh, no said Flora biting into an apple. I am having my own feast. I love fruit!
P6	It was getting late. The animals were gathering at the waterhole. So, Elephant raised his trunk and asked, Are you all coming to the feast?@Yes, said Frog.@Yes, said Giraffe.@I will, said Hippo.@On my way, said Iguana.@I will, said Jackal.
P7	Lion roared in agreement. It is my feast and I want everyone to be there!@The little frogs croaked in agreement. Kudu said, I will be the speaker because I am the one who is most calm.
P8	Monkey threw berries at them. @Don't forget me he shouted, as they all ran for cover. Then Aye, Bee, Cat, Cock, Dog, Elephant, Frog, Giraffe, Hippo, Iguana, Jackal, Kudu, Lion and Monkey walked towards the feast.
P9	Monkey teased Newt, I will get there before you. Yiu are too slow and all the food will be eaten. Newt smiled, slow an steady wins the race he warned.
P10	Ostrich hurried to fetch her children. It was getting very dark.@Are you coming shouted Porcupine? I see all of you are in a hurry. Let's rest for the evening. We will travel together in the morning.@So they all slept together near a hut.
P11	That morning the animals said goodbye to Aye and Bee. But as Cock crowed his mighty, Good Morning, they all rushed to leave. It was the day of the feast!@Cat, Dog, Elephant, Frog, Giraffe, Hippo, Iguana, Jackal, Kudu, Lion and Monkey left.
P12	Newt, Ostrich and Porcupine were the last to leave. Along came Queen Bee.@You will need my honey to sweeten the feast, she said. Rabbit agreed, he loved all things sweet.@Snail smiled. Can I get a ride on you Monkey?
P13	Cat, Cock, Dog, Elephant, Frog, Giraffe, Hippo, Iguana, Jackal, Kudu, Lion, Monkey, Newt, Ostrich, Porcupine, Queen Bee, Rabbit, Snail and Tortoise walked towards the feast. Tortoise was excited. He wanted to join the pack.
P14	Under the great African Sunrise, the animals felt hungry and excited. Vervet Monkey, Waterbuffalo, and Zebra all joined the walk to the Valley of the Feast There was Leopard and Rhino,too. They were all talking at once.
P15	They were excited. They all greeted each other. Some danced, others sang. It was the feast of all feasts and everyone was going to just have fun.
P16	Soon, Leopard who was hurt of sorts, called them to silence.@My friends, brothers and sisters, the feast has now begun.@And that day all the animals celebrated until the full Moon rose high above the sky.
