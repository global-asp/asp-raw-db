page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, in the village of Shandam, there was a young man who lived with his parents.
P2	This young man was very respectful to his parents and to all the other people in the village. His name was Tanko Malami.
P3	Mondays are a busy day in the village as the children get ready for school after the weekend.@@One day, on his way to school, Tanko met a boy called Bangis. They chatted along the way and became friends.
P4	Bangis was always fighting, bullying others and bunking school. He was a bad person who gambled and enjoyed the company of other bad people. Slowly but surely Bangis influenced Tanko. Tanko did not want to be seen as uncool and he started behaving as badly as Bangis.
P5	Tanko became a bully and disrespected his parents and people he used to respect. He became a drunkard and was unable to look after himself.
P6	Tanko became reckless and got sexually transmitted infections. He became so thin that Bangis made jokes and didn't want to be his friend any more. Tanko's parents encouraged him to visit a local clinic to get medication. After taking medication he became better.
P7	Tanko reflected on his life. He realized that he had befriended an enemy. He started working at school and apologized to his parents and teachers.
P8	Bangis was disappointed by Tanko's good behavior. But he was embarrassed by his own behavior and decided to change and became a better person.
