page_text:

P1	One sunny day, on top of the hill lived a red rooster and a clever mongoose. The mongoose was pretty but full of cunning manners.
P2	One morning the mongoose felt vey hungry. She then took a walk searching for food. While she was loking for food, she saw a rooster sitting on top of the big old tree.
P3	"Good morning my friend." greeted a mongoose.@"Why are you still there?" she asked.@"There was a meeting today for all animals. It was important for all of us be there." said the mongoose.
P4	"What was the meeting all about?" he asked.  @She replied, "Get down from the tree my friend so I can tell you the good news about the meeting." @@"Good news, animals will no longer eat each other." she said.
P5	The rooster was so excited to hear the news.@ He climbed down the tree very quickly. @@When he got on the last branch of the tree, he stopped. Something was not right.
P6	He looked at the mongoose eyes that was standing under the tree. @The rooster went back, up the tree. @He said, "Have you seen the dogs running up the river?" He continued, @"Did the dogs go for the meeting?"
P7	The mongoose was very scared.@"Where?" she asked.@"They ran up the river and they will come this side very soon." said the rooster.@The mongoose tried to check the direction that the dogs took, but didn't see anything.
P8	She stood on her hind legs and said, "Oh no! I don't think the dogs heard the news. They were not listening during the meeting." She looked left and right. She ran very fast and got lost on the spot. That is how rooster was saved.
