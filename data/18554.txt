P1	Once upon a time in a village called woza nawe there was a widow who was known as having a salt business as she had a salt machine.
P2	People would come to her asking for a secret of running such a successful business.
P3	People from neighborhood would send their children to come and buy salt from this widow,  as she owned a salt machine.
P4	Every time people came to buy salt,  she went to her corner to speak to the machine " mfana  yenza njalo" and machine would start producing salt for her,  and she would stop the machine by saying "wenze kahle mfana."
P5	One day knocked a stranger into her house at sunset saying: sikhulekile ekhaya a strangers stomach is not that big but of bird's gizzard' the widow welcomed the stranger as it was starting to be dark,  as a way of showing generosity.  .
P6	The stranger promised the widow that  he will wake up in the morning and leave as early as it is,  people came to buy the salt as usually and the man noticed how the widow spoke to the machine.
P7	When the widow was fast asleep the stranger man went to her corner to speak to the machine" yenza njalo mfana" the machine produced the salt as it was the song it knwe and when the man was done testing the machine he said" wenze kahle mfana'' the machine suddenly stopped."
P8	The man was filled with joy and excitement as he already planned to open a business with this machine as he was going to steal the machine from the widow.
P9	The man woke up early in the morning to catch a bus to the sea,  running away with the widow's salt machine to the beach,  the man got into the bus as it was ready to go.
P10	The people of the village tried to help the widow in searching for the man who is ungrateful who stole from a widow,  but nowhere to find this man.
P11	The man got to the beach and caught a boat sailing to overseas where he planned to open the business with the widow's salt machine,  he got two men inside the boat, when the man was in the middle of the sea started to speak with the machine to check if the machine is still working he went by" yenza mfana" the machine did as usually and produced salt,  so when he was enough he said" wenze kahle mfana" trying to stop the machine but the machine did not stop until they drowned to death. Until now the machine is producing salt that's why sea water is full of salt.  .
