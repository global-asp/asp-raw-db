desc:	Thokoziles response when she found out about her status.

page_text:

P1	There once once a girl named Thokozile. 	Thokozile was the youngest of three children, her two brothers and mother was very over protective of Thokozile. Thokozile was a joyful, free spirited girl and she had many friends, some of which were bad influences on her. Her mother warned her not to hang around those kids, but given Thokozile's free spirit she didn't take into account what her mother had said, so Thokozile was often in trouble.
P2	Thokozile's mother made her drink pills everyday saying that it was her treatment, her mother kept@her status a secret. As Thokozile grew older she wanted to know what this treatment was all about @and why she had to drink it.
P3	One day as they were waiting in line at the hospital, Thokozile asked her mother what it meant@when they say that you are a chronic patient.
P4	Later that day when they got home her mother sat her down and explained to her that she would have to take pills, to prevent her disease from getting worse and she @would have to drink these pills everyday for as long as she lived, her mother further explained that @she was HIV positive, her mother told her that she had the disease and was not to tell @anybody about it.
P5	Thokozile went to her room and she cried, she couldn't stop crying and all she could think about was dying.
P6	Thokozile couldn't cope with what she had just learnt about herself. She then went for counselling, @Thokozile learnt about HIV, How to deal with it and what it does to the body.
P7	As time passed by and Thokozile grew older and became used to living with the disease that she didn't even care that she had it. Everyday she woke up and looked at herself in the mirror and said I'M BEAUTIFUL, no matter what, I don't care what people say about me as long as I'm alive I will always thank GOD for giving me these days.
P8	Everyday when drinking her pills she would look at the pills and say: You might be small, but you are @big on the inside of my body, you Mr pill, you are my friend.
P9	You Mr Pill will always be there for me, wherever I am, wherever I go or whatever I do.  I am extremely greatful for my life.
