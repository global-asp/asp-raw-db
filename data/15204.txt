P1	I woke up very early to go to get ready for school.
P2	   Mother was annoyed. I was too slow dressing up.
P3	I ate my breakfast.
P4	I met my friends in school.
P5	In class,  I opened my school bag. Oops! Mother's phone!' I still had mother's phone. I returned it in my school bag.
P6	It was time to go home. I looked into my school bag. Oops! Mother's phone was not in my school bag.
P7	I started crying. The teacher asked,  "What is the problem,  Wanjiku?" I could not talk. I covered my face with my hand.
P8	Finally,  I said,  "Mother's phone is lost." Teacher was surprised. We started looking for the phone.
P9	I danced around in class. "Thank you teacher. Thank you teacher!"
P10	I put mother's phone in my school bag. I said to myself,  "I will not play with mother's phone again."
