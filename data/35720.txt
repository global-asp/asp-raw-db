P1	Juma was a poor young man. He lived in Runogone village. His friend was Kanini. @@Kanini was good to Juma and all the villagers liked her. @@Juma had a very big farm but he did not plant anything on it.
P2	Every day Juma begged for food from the villagers. @@No one gave him food except Kanini and one couple.@@Kanini told Juma, "Stop being lazy my friend. You have a big farm."
P3	Another day Kanini said, "If you cannot farm, look for a job before you die of hunger." @ @"I have been looking for a job for a long time without success," Juma answered. @@The next day Juma went to work on his farm.
P4	When Kanini visited, she found Juma on his farm. @@From then, Juma worked hard as a farmer. He never begged again. He never went hungry again.
P5	Kanini continued to support Juma as he worked on his lang.@@At least, Juma could now support himself.@@He could also help those who once helped him.
