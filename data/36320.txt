desc:	Two boys go on a picnic  but end up doing a good  deed by helping a hungry  monkey

page_text:

P1	Jabu and Joseph lived with their grandfather. One day the boys wanted to go and have a picnic by the river. Their grandfather packed them a basket  of food to eat.
P2	They were happily walking and chatting excitedly  about where they wanted to go for their picnic.  Suddenly they heard an odd scary noise nearby. They slowed down, looking around to see what caused the noise.
P3	All of a sudden, a monkey appeared in front of them, jumping up and down. Jabu said "what is wrong?" The monkey kept jumping around chattering continuously.  Now the boys were getting nervous thinking  the monkey  was going to attack  them
P4	The monkey stopped jumping and looked at the boys' basket. Jabu said to Joseph : " I think he's hungry, let's give him the basket  of food and he will leave us alone". Joseph agreed. The monkey grabbed the basket from them
P5	The monkey was definitely  hungry as he immediately  opened the basket and started eating  some of the food. Suddenly a dog burst out of the nearby bushes
P6	The dog attacked the monkey. The boys tried to distract  the dog by taking food and throwing  it for the dog to eat as it  might be hungry  too. Luckily that worked as the dog took the food and ran off. The monkey  and boys went home
P7	When they got home, they told their grandfather  of their adventure. He said they had done a good thing helping others and was proud of them. He gave them some food he had left over from the basket  he made earlier. They were all happy
