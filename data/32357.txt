page_text:

P1	One Sabbath Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees. When Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable:@@—When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor.
P2	A person more distinguished than you may have been invited by your host. So the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, "Give this man your place." Then, ashamed, you will have to move to the least important place.
P3	But when you are invited, go and take the least important place, so that when your host approaches he will say to you, "Friend, move up here to a better place."
P4	Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.
P5	Jesus also said to the man who had invited him: @@—When you host a dinner or a banquet, don't invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors so you can be invited by them in return and get repaid.
P6	But when you host an elaborate meal, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
P7	Then you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
