page_text:

P1	There lived a fox, a lion and a rabbit in a beautiful forest. There was a village near the forest.
P2	One day as the fox was walking a nail pierced its paw and it screemed. The rabbit heard that and went running.
P3	Shocked, the rabbit asked what happened. The fox begged the rabbit to remove the nail.
P4	The rabbit said, "I will remove the nail if you promise that you will not eat me." Since the fox felt the pain from the nail it promised.
P5	The rabbit removed the nail feeling fearful.
P6	Then she wrapped it with a leaf.
P7	After the nail has been removed, the fox said to the rabbit, "Thanks for removing it. Now, I will take you home and eat you." Then it carried it home.
P8	While it was taking it home, a lion walking nearby roared and scared the fox away.
P9	The rabbit thanked the lion for saving it from the fox and started walking away. The lion asked, "Can we be friends?" The rabbit happily agreed and they went together. Their friendship started this way.
P10	They lived as friends for a long time. People came to the forest to hunt.
P11	The lion went to hunt.
P12	Hunters came to the forest and met the lion. They set a trap and held it.
P13	They took it with them, kept it in the net and rested themselves under a tree.
P14	The rabbit went out in search of its friend. It saw the lion trapped under tree.
P15	She tore the net and set the lion free. Then they went home.
