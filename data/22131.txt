desc:	A proud child could not fulfil a promise she made to a river god

page_text:

P1	Long time ago, there lived three friends in a village called Domeabra. Their names were Adeɛpɛna, Nyamekyɛ and Ntiamoa.
P2	These three friends loved each other and were true to each other. Their friendship also brought their families together.
P3	In this village, every Friday was a market day. On Fridays, nobody went to farm.

It was also the day that nobody went to the River Dome.
P4	Adeɛpɛna was the only child of Papa Koo Nimo and Maame Adoma. Her parents never corrected her when she was wrong. Adeɛpɛna became proud.
P5	One Friday, the three friends decided to go in search of kola nuts in the forest. They wanted to sell at the market. 

After their parents left for the market, they also set off to the forest.
P6	They came to the River Dome, which was very full. Ntiamoa shouted, "Eei! How can we cross this river?"  

Nyamekyɛ answered, "I have read that when rivers overflow their banks you can cross by making a sacrifice."
P7	The children did not have anything to offer at that time, so they made promises to the river.

Ntiamoa said, "Nana Dome if you will allow me to cross over, I will offer you three times three kola nuts." Nyamekyɛ made the same promise.
P8	When Adeɛpɛna's turn came, because of her pride, she promised, "Nana Dome, if you will allow me to cross over, on my return I will offer three times two kola nuts and two eggs." 

River Dome responded, "My grandchildren, cross over, and remember to fulfil your promises."
P9	After the children crossed the river safely they went into the forest. They soon all filled their sacks with kola nuts.  

On their way home they got to the river again.  This time the water was even higher.
P10	Ntiamoa and Nyamekyɛ fulfilled their promises and the river allowed them to cross. 

When it was Adeɛpɛna's turn, she did not have the two eggs that she promised. The river would not allow her to cross.
P11	It was getting dark. The two friends hurried home to tell Adeɛpɛna's parents what had happened. 

Papa Koo Nimo went out to help his daughter.
P12	Adeɛpɛna was frightened because she was alone. 

As she was crossing the river, she started to drown.
P13	When Papa Koo Nimo got closer to the river he heard a song.

"Flying Bird! Go and tell my mother. Go and tell my father. Bring two eggs. River Dome is taking me away!"
P14	Papa Koo Nimo hurried to the river bank and realised that his daughter was drowning.  He could only see her hair.
P15	He quickly grabbed her hair and tried to pull Adeɛpɛna out of the river.

Unfortunately, only her hair stayed in the palms of his hands. Her body slipped away under the water.
P16	Out of sorrow, he hit his chest with the palms of his hands and shouted, "Adeɛpɛna, what have you done to me?"  

Adeepena's hair stuck to her father's chest. 

And that is why men have chest hairs.
