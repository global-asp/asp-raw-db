P1	Thomas gets tricked.
P2	Thomas the Tank Engine lives in a big station on the island of Sodor.
P3	he's a cheeky little engine with six small wheels,
P4	A short Stumpy funnel,
P5	A short Stumpy boiler,  & a short Stumpy Dome.
P6	He's a fussy little Engine too, always pulling Freight cars about ready for the bigger engines to take out on Long Journeys.
P7	And when trains come in he pulls Freight cars away for another train.
P8	Thomas loves to play tricks on the engines, including Percy the little, green engine.
P9	Thomas likes to Teese Percy with his whistle.
P10	" wake up lazy bones why don't you work hard like me."
P11	So instead of going to sleep again, Percy thought how to get back at Thomas.
P12	The next morning Thomas won,t wake up, his driver and fireman can,t make him start.
P13	His fire went out,
P14	And there was not enough Steam.
P15	It was nearly time for the freight train, the Coal car was there, but not the Caboose.
P16	At last, Thomas started.
P17	"Oh Dear Oh Dear," he yawned.
P18	He puffed into the station when Percy was waiting.
P19	"Hurry up, you," said Percy.
P20	"Hurry up, yourself," replied Thomas.
P21	Percy began making his plan.
P22	"Yes," said Percy "I will.
P23	Almost before the Caboose stopped moving, Percy reversed quickly, and was coupled to the train. "Load the freight cars quickly, please,"he Whistled.
P24	Thomas usually pushed behind the big trains to help them start, But he was always have uncoupled first.
P25	This time, Percy started so quickly they forgot to uncouple Thomas, Percy's chance had come.
P26	"Come on, come on," called Percy to the freight cars.
P27	The train went faster and faster, too fast for Thomas, he wanted to stop but he couldn't, "peep, peep, stop, stop".
P28	"Hurry, hurry, hurry," laughed Percy.
P29	"you can,t get away, you can,t get away," laughed the trucks.
P30	Poor Thomas was going faster than other gone before, he was out of breath, and his wheels hurt him, but he had to go on.
P31	"I shall never be the same again," he thought sadly, "my wheels will be quite worn out."
P32	At last, they stopped in the station.
P33	Thomas was uncoupled, and He felt very silly and exhausted.
P34	Next, he went on to a turntable thinking of everyone and laughing at him.
P35	Then, he ran onto a siding out of the way.
P36	"Well, Thomas," chuckled Percy, "now you know how it work means, don't you.
P37	Poor Thomas didn't answer, he had no breath, he just puffed slowly away to rest, and had a long long drink.
P38	"Maybe I don't have to tease Percy to feel important," Thomas said to himself, and he puffed slowly home.
P39	The end.
P40	Look for Thomas gets tricked, and other exciting Thomas books from random house, where are more books are sold.
