page_text:

P1	There lived a Hyena and a Raven. They were great friends and they lived together in one house. These two friends went in search of food together at all times.
P2	One day, Raven told Hyena that he had seen a beehive somewhere. They agreed to go and harvest the honey. As they came close, Hyena told Raven to climb the tree. Raven did not hesitate so he went up the tree and started harvesting the honey.
P3	He threw the honey down to Hyena for him to put it in a basket, but he did not do as expected. All this while, Raven was not aware of Hyena's tricks.
P4	When Raven came down, he found nothing in the basket. Hyena had eaten everything and hence his stomach grew very big. He told Raven to sew his back so that the sweetness from the honey would not come out of his stomach.
P5	Days passed without Hyena going to the toilet. Every day, he grew bigger and very uncomfortable. The discomfort caused him alot of struggle. He could not eat or sleep. He decided to go and look for Raven.
P6	He wanted Raven to open his back and ease the discomfort. By then, Raven had already found a new home of his own where he felt safe and happy.
P7	On his way he met Goat. He asked him whether he had seen Raven but goat told him he hadn't and urged him to continue searching.
P8	The next day he met Hare. Again Hyena asked him whether he had seen Raven. Hare told him that he would find Raven seated under a tree.
P9	Finally, Hyena found Raven sitting down. He told him that since he sewed his back, he had not been able to relieve himself and thus he was very uncomfortable. He pleaded with Raven to unsew his back.
P10	Raven agreed and with his beak he opened Hyena's back. Immediately, feaces came out and burried him. Hyena was very happy to be relieved but ungrateful because he left Raven there struggling. Since that day the Raven turned black.
