P10	At 3 o'clock school is over and Ismail goes home. He reaches 45 minutes later. When does he reach home?

P12	After playing for three hours and fifteen minutes,  Ismail eats his supper quickly. He is always hungry. But he also gets tired from eating. By nine thirty he is usually in bed. But his grandmother always tells him a story before he sleeps. Five minutes to ten his grandmother has told her story and Ismail is ready to sleep. How long was the story?
P13	Ismail's grandmother spent 25 minutes telling her story? How much time did you spend reading this one?
