page_text:

P1	There was a boy whose name was Abel. He made himself a cart. 

Abel had no driver for his new cart. He said to his sister Meri, "I want a driver for my cart. Please give me your doll. She can sit in the cart."
P2	But Meri said, "No, I want my doll." When Meri would not let him take the doll, Abel was very angry. He grabbed the doll and pulled her. 

Meri pulled the doll's other arm. Abel pulled and Meri pulled. The doll's arm came off!
P3	Meri cried and ran to her mother. "Look Mother," she said, "Abel pulled my doll's arm and it came off. He wanted my doll to sit in his new cart but I wanted to play with her." 

Her mother said, "Abel did not behave well."
P4	Mother thought about how to teach her son not to touch his sister's toys. She had an idea. 

She went to her friend who was a doctor and she asked, "I want you to help me please." The doctor replied, "How can I help, my friend?"
P5	Mother answered, "My son Abel is behaving badly these days. He pulled the arm off his sister's doll. He must not do that. 

Tomorrow I will tell him to bring the doll to you to put the doll's arm on again."
P6	"Please tell Abel that he must pay you for your work. He doesn't have any money, so you will tell him to clean your big old car that is always dusty," said mother. 

Her friend laughed and said, "Ee–ee! That will be good."
P7	Abel's mother went back to her house. She asked Abel, "When you are ill or hurt where do you go?" Abel answered, "When I am ill or hurt, I must go to the doctor." 

Abel's mother said, "You hurt the doll, now you must take her to the doctor."
P8	So Abel took the doll to the doctor. "This doll is hurt very badly. My mother told me to bring the doll to you. Doctor, can you give her a new arm?" 

The doctor agreed to look after the doll. She was able to make a new arm.
P9	The doctor said to Abel, "The doll has a new arm. You must pay me. How much money do you have?" 

Abel answered, "Please doctor, I don't have any money. I can't pay you for your work."
P10	The doctor said, "Well! You don't have any money? My big car is very dirty! Clean my car and that is how you will pay me." 

Abel got a bucket of water and a clean cloth. It took a long time to wash that dusty car.
P11	Then Abel took the doll back to Meri. She was delighted and she said to Abel, "You are a good brother. Thank you for fixing my doll." 

"My sister, I'm sorry for getting angry and making you sad," said Abel.
P12	From that day, Abel never took his sister's things again. And he tried his best not to get angry with her.

Abel remembered how long it took him to wash the doctor's big, dirty car. He decided it wasn't worth the price to get angry and break things.
