page_text:

P1	There was a young beautiful mule called Wardit.
P2	A handsome horse said, “I must marry Wardit.”
P3	The horse said, “Let us go together to the river.”
P4	The horse asked Wardit to be his wife. Wardit agreed.
P5	The horse asked Wardit, “Who are your father and mother?”
P6	Wardit said, “My mother lives in the king’s palace.”
P7	“My sister lives in the Church compound. Don’t you know her?”
P8	She added, “My beautiful aunt lives with the village headman.”
P9	Then an old donkey walked by. It was Wardit’s father.
P10	Wardit did not greet her father or look at him.
P11	The old donkey asked, “What is the matter, my girl?"
P12	The horse asked Wardit, “Who is this stupid donkey?”
P13	Wardit said, “I don’t know him.”
P14	The horse kicked the old donkey.
P15	The old donkey was heart-broken. He cried and died.
P16	Because Wardit did not respect her father, she cannot have children.
