page_text:

P1	In a nearby town,there was an old woman who lived in her hut alone.She was always doing things herself and the villagers around wondered if she had anyone.Until one day,she was sitting in her hut,deep in thought when a fairy visited her.
P2	"Hello,my name is Ariel and I was sent to grant you just three wishes", Ariel smiled when the old woman screamed in horror.Ariel stared at her,perplexed.@" I don't believe in fairies,my child and i only wish to be alone",The old woman said.
P3	Ariel pitied her. "I mean no harm mama,the villagers mumurs got to my goddess and she decided to help you".@The old woman pondered on what she should ask for." I have nothing else as you can see and that means I have lots to ask for".
P4	Ariel smiled."I know you have this uttermost desires in your heart and I was instructed to grant three.What about you start from having a new home".She said as the old woman nodded.@Ariel whispered some words and everything began to change.
P5	Suddenly the old woman met herself in a beautiful made room.She exclaimed in joy as she saw everything right in front of her eyes.@"Is this really a dream or am I in this big house?. Ohh,it must be a dream",She laughed to herself in joy.
P6	As Ariel appeared,the old woman sat down,looking a bit distraught."Don't you like here?You asked for a home and I gave you one".@The old woman hissed."This is only a room,no kitchen,nothing here pleases me.My hut is even better".
P7	"But...", Ariel tried to talk when she interrupted.@" I thought you were sent to make me happy,can't you see this? This room isn't suitable for me.I want a better one than this. I want the villagers to know your goddess visited me".
P8	"Okay" Ariel sighed."Remember this is your second wish and your last wish must not be said carelessly,remember that".@"I will, just get me out of here", The old woman said as Ariel murmured some words and everything began to change again.
P9	In less than ten seconds, the old woman found herself in a large room, elegant and beautiful than the last one.Her wish had really come true again and she could live a better life but couldn't she live the best of all these?",She thought.
P10	Ariel came,seeing her complaining again.She wondered why humans seem very hard to please. She just hoped this old woman won't be so greedy to lose this last chance.@"I need a better one with a house help too".@Ariel stared at her,shocked.
P11	Ariel sighed."Aren't you talking already?,or take me back to my hut.my hut or you take me to a better place?", The old woman said as suddenly everything began to change. Ariel found herself,unable to control herself from stopping the magic!
P12	The old woman screamed in horror as she found herself back in her hut and Ariel nowhere to be found.She sighed in sadness as she wondered when such opportunity would come again.
P13	Lesson Learnt;Always Think Before You Act.@Imbibe Contentment.
