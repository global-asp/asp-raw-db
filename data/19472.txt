P1	"Mojalefa,  please go to the shop," said his mother. "Go to Ntate Ramosebetsi's shop. Buy some chicken. We will eat it tonight."
P2	Mojalefa 's mother gave him M50. Mojalefa put the money in the pocket of his trousers.
P3	He walked past 'M'e Malekau's house. He walked past Ntate Pitso's field. He walked past 'M'e Mampho's house. She was washing her clothes in her yard.
P4	It was a long way to Ntate Ramosebetsi 's shop. Mojalefa walked very slowly. He put his hand in his pocket. The M50 was there.
P5	But aaah,  there was something else in his pocket. It was a sweet. "Mmmm," said Mojalefa. "This sweet will help me walk this long way." He put the sweet in his mouth. "Mmmm,  this sweet is truly delicious!"
P6	He walked faster. Soon he got to Ntate Ramosebetsi's shop. He found the chicken. He went to pay for it.
P7	He put his hand in his pocket. The M50 was not there! He looked in his other pocket. The M50 was not there!
P8	Mojalefa was very worried. He ran out of the shop. He did know what to do. He must go home without the chicken. He knew that his mother would be very angry.
P9	He walked slowly. He looked all around at the ground. He could see 'M'e Mampho. She was still washing her clothes.
P10	"Why do you look so sad Mojalefa?" she asked him. "I have lost my mother's money. My mother will be very angry," he said. 'M'e Mampho said,  "If you look carefully,  I am sure you will find it."
P11	Mojalefa walked some more. He looked all around at the ground. Then he saw a little pink piece of paper. There it was. It was his mother's M50!
P12	Mojalefa picked it up. "'M'e Mampho! I found it," he said. He ran all the way to Ntate Ramosebetsi's shop. He was very happy. Now he could buy the chicken for his mother. If you were Mojalefa,  how would you feel?
