page_text:

P1	One day while me and my family went for a walk in the forest, I heard a strange noise coming from the trees while we were resting.
P2	With fear in my voice, I asked my grandmother, " What was that?" She said:" it sounded like a monkey or maybe a baboon." Suddenly my fear changes in to excitement because I have never seen a monkey before.
P3	However, out of excitement I wanted to know if it is possible to see them in real life, but my grandmother warns us that they can be dangerous sometimes. All I wanted was to see them from up close.
P4	After we were done resting, we continue walking through the forest. As I looked around I realize that it was the most beautiful forest ever. It also had the most beautiful trees. As we keep on walking, I saw the most biggest tree ever.
P5	I was amazed by the size of this tree. I could not stop staring at this tree with my mouth hanging open. Suddenly I saw a quick movement and there it was, the monkeys I have been waiting to see all day long.
P6	At first I could not believe it but as I keep on watching I realize that it was real. I saw two monkeys in real life for the first time of my life. By that moment I wish I had my camera with me to capture this beautiful moment in my life.
P7	I will never forget this day. It was the best day of my life. Nature offered me the most beautiful experience I have ever had. I never knew that there were so much beauty in nature.@ @I will relive this day anytime of my life.
P8	Me and my family went for a walk in the forest. While we were walking we saw a few interesting stuff in the forest. We could not believe our eyes but it was the most beautiful experience ever.@@Found out more about our journey in the forest
