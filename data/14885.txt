P1	Aunt Merane gave some money to Joe. "Go. Go to the shop. Buy sugar and bread."
P2	Joe picked an old car tyre. He ran fast with it to the shop.
P3	Before reaching the shop,  he saw a ball. He forgot the tyre. He picked up the ball and kicked it.
P4	He saw a flying bird andÂ wanted to catch it.
P5	He saw cows. He stopped and started singing to them.
P6	"Where is Joe?" asked Jessica. "He is just late but he is coming," Aunt Merane said.
P7	Uncle Don sat with baby Tara. He wanted to have breakfast before going for work.
P8	Joe saw a puppy. He ran with it around the fields.
P9	He got tired. He sat down and checked his pocket. The money was not there.
P10	He ran home without sugar and bread.
P11	"Joe,  where is sugar and bread? Where is the money?'' asked Aunt Merane."
P12	"I am very sorry,  Aunt Merane. I played too much and lost the money."
