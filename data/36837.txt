P1	Long time ago, elephant had no trunck and was the smelliest animal.
P2	Flies could spin around him always. His best friend is tortoise. Because elephant has no trunck, he couldn't smell. No ever told that he smells. Even tortoise.
P3	One day, he asked chameleon for help, he couldn't help. But maybe the flies. Chameleon told elephant that he smells very bad.
P4	He felt bad and started crying. He reached the pond while smelling and crying all night.
P5	Crocodile who was in the pond, grabbed his nose and pulled elephant.
P6	Every one woke up to help elephant, they pulled and pulled his nose untill it became long.
P7	Monkey asked elephant the name of his new nose. Elephant answered, a truck.
