page_text:

P1	There was aÂ shepherd who had no grass to feed his pig, sheep and goat and no grains for his hen. He had no barn to keep them warm.
P2	He decided to take them where they could get food and shelter.
P3	The shepherd said, "I could sell them for a quarter each." But the man was negotiating for a lower price.
P4	The man said, "I only want the goat." But the shepherd said, "These animals are friends. I want all of them to be together."
P5	The shepherd sold the sheep, the goat and the pig for a quarter each. He gave the hen for free. He was sad as he headed home.
P6	He realised they weren't just animals. They were also his friends. So he went back to return the money and take his friends home.
P7	"They are mine now," the man said. "I won't give them back." But the shepherd kept begging.
P8	"I realised they are not just animals but also my friends," said the shepherd. The man asked, "Why did you sell them in the first place?"
P9	A neighbour heard the argument and said, "Make a barn, provide grass and grains. Then you can get your animals back."
P10	The shepherd loved his animals. He gave back the money and took home his friends to a perfect barn and plenty of grass and grains.
