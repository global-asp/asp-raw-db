page_text:

P1	After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school.@@ They came to the river they had to cross every day. "Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya.
P2	"Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?"@@Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. @@"Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said.
P3	Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river! "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. @@But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away.
P4	"Run and get help!" shouted Linda. "Tell them to call the free emergency number ‪112‬, like the Sea Rescue lady told us."@@"Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water.
P5	"Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch that he could use to help his friend. @@Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away.
P6	Luckily, Lungi could float. He managed to grab the branch that Phelelani held out to him. @@Phelelani pulled Lungi to the safety of the river bank.
P7	The children walked back to Lungi's home with him. He was soaking wet but relieved to be alive. @@His mother was very thankful that he was safe. @@"Thank you!" she said to Phelelani. "You saved my boy because you knew what to do!"
P8	Lungi's father hugged his son. @@"I know you really wanted to go to school," he said to Lungi. "But always remember the Sea Rescue lesson. If the river is flooding, don't cross it! Call an adult for help."
P9	The next day, when the river was back to normal, the children could cross it and go to school. @@They told the teacher what had happened.
P10	"Wow! That was frightening!" said teacher. "The most important thing is that Lungi is safe. I am sure you will never try to cross a flooded river again." @@"Let's talk about this in class today so everyone knows how dangerous rivers can be," added teacher as the lesson began.
