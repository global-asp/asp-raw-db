desc:	This grim folktale from the Nyungwe people of Mozambique reminds us of the importance of having older people in our communities.

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, it happened in a village that a gang of young people decided to kill all the old people. @@They wanted to stop the old people doing magic.
P2	But one of the youths ran off with his father and hid him in the desert.
P3	After he had done this, the gang began killing the old people.
P4	Not long after, a snake came into the village from the desert.@@The snake entered into the stomach of a small child. It kept poking its head out of the child's mouth.
P5	The parents of the child and all the other people tried everything to solve this problem.
P6	But they saw that if they killed the snake it would also kill the child. Everyone kept trying different things.
P7	Then, the young man who had hidden his father went and told him everything that had happened. @@And the old man replied, "That's the easiest thing in the world to take care of!"
P8	The old man said, "Go find a toad and tie it up near the snake. The snake will come out of the child's stomach to catch the toad."@@The young man did just what his father said. The snake came out and started to chase the toad.
P9	And the child was saved from death.
