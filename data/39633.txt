page_text:

P1	One day, Elephant was walking in the forest.@@He saw Rat, and laughed.
P2	Rat asked, "Elephant, why are you laughing?"@@Elephant replied, "You are such a little creature. If the bigger animals want to eat you, they can."
P3	Rat was angry at Elephant and told her how confident he was.@@After this conversation, they went their ways.
P4	On another day, beautiful trees, flowers and grass filled the field. @@Rat stopped to appreciate all this from the comfort of the stone on which he sat.
P5	After seeing all the beauty in nature, Rat shifted his attention to another thing.
P6	Lion was hiding nearby, in the tall grass.
P7	Rat followed everything attentively.
P8	Rat saw Antelope grazing. He learned that Lion was waiting for the right time to catch Antelope. @@Lion was walking slowly and silently toward Antelope.
P9	Rat thought of how to save Antelope from Lion. @@An idea came to his mind.
P10	When Lion was getting closer to Antelope, Rat climbed onto Lion's back.
P11	He started biting Lion's back. Lion felt pain and started screaming and jumping. @@As he did this, he went outside of his hideout.
P12	Antelope saw Lion coming out and learned that Rat had saved her. @@Antelope ran away from the place.
P13	Lion was angry. Rat came down from Lion's back. @@Lion warned Rat saying, "You made Antelope escape. I will get you one day!"
P14	Elephant couldn't find Rat. She met Antelope and asked her if she had seen Rat. Antelope told Elephant everything that had happened. @@Elephant was shocked and surprised at the same time. She felt bad about what she had told Rat.
P15	Another day Antelope went to Rat. @@She thanked him and promised to pay him one day.
P16	On another day, Lion caught Rat. Antelope saw this. She ran to them and hit Lion with her horns. @@The three of them ran to different places. Lion thought that he should go away from that place.
P17	Elephant felt sorry and asked Rat to forgive her. @@Rat said to Elephant, "I forgive you. Don't look at my size!" Elephant promised to apply Rat's advice.
P18	After that time, Antelope, Rat and Elephant lived in the same area, loving and supporting one another. @@They promised never to separate.
