page_text:

P1	     Once upon a time there was a girl called Thandi.          She loved to dance. She danced everyday.  .
P2	     Everyday she would go to school. She got up                early,  brushed her hair and teeth and went to                  school.
P3	     At school she would dance. Thandi danced and            danced. She put on little shows for the children.
P4	      One day a teacher saw her dancing and she told           one of her friends who ran a dance studio.
P5	      The woman who ran the dance studio was                     pleased to meet Thandi and offered her a place at       the studio,  in the city!    .
P6	       Thandi said yes, it was her dream!And she lived               happily ever after!
