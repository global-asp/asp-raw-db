page_text:

P1	On the beautiful farm of Mazuri lived many animals and one large garden all under the ownership and care of Mr.Martin.
P2	Harold was the only horse on the farm. This meant he had to do most of the heavy work
P3	There were bulls, cows, goats and even donkeys on Mazuri farm.
P4	But all the cart carrying was left to Harold and the donkeys.
P5	This meant, that without the Harold and the donkeys the other animals would have no food to eat back at home away from the garden.
P6	Sometimes the donkeys complained. "On other farms, even oxen and cows carry the load and pull the cart," the donkeys said.
P7	"We shall therefore also not carry anything today," they striked.
P8	Harold was then forced to carry all the load alone and didn't complain.
P9	With the market day approaching, Mr.Martin had to choose what animals to sell off.
P10	The cows mooed about how they were the source of milk and could not be sold. the other animals shared the mutual feeling.
P11	When market day came, Mr.Martin chose to sell most of his animals in order to get what he believed were better breeds.
P12	"I shan't keep animals that cannot do anything else but breed and feed", Mr.Martin echoed.
P13	This left Harold sad as his friends would be no more for he loved them sometimes more than himself.
