desc:	Four girls go out to pick wild fruits. When three play a dirty trick on the other one

page_text:

P1	One day Akadeli,  Lucy,  Acharait and Mary went to the forest far from home to pick wild fruits. They held hands to cross the big river near the forest.
P2	They found a tree full of ripe fruits. The girls agreed to climb up the tree and to pick the fruits with their eyes closed.
P3	Lucy,  Acharait and Mary did not close their eyes. Only Akadeli closed hers as she picked the fruits.
P4	When they opened their eyes,  only Akadeli had picked unripe fruits.
P5	Lucy,  Acharait and Mary laughed at Akadeli and left for home. Akadeli threw away the unripe fruits and began picking ripe ones.
P6	Soon,  Akadeli filled her basket with ripe fruits. She set off alone,  crossing the big river.
P7	Half way across the river,  Akadeli's basket fell and was carried away. She was angry and began to cry.
P8	Before Akadeli got out of the water,  she saw a big fish and grabbed it.
P9	As Akadeli carried the fish home,  a hawk snatched it and flew away with it.
P10	Akadeli saw that the hawk had left behind a feather from its tail. Although she was disappointed,  she picked up the feather and continued walking home.
P11	She came across a traditional wedding. People dancing were wearing grass on their heads instead of feathers as was the tradition. They took her feather and gave her a big bull!
P12	Akadeli reached home with her bull. Her parents and relatives were so happy. Lucy,  Acharait and Mary wished they had not lied to Akadeli. It was a lucky day for Akadeli!
