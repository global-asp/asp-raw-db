page_text:

P1	One day, a farmer went to the market.@@He forgot to give fodder to his donkey before he left home.
P2	After a while, the hungry donkey opened the stable door.@@He went out and ate.@@Then, he decided to go for a walk.
P3	As the donkey was walking, he stood on a thorn.@@The thorn pierced his hoof, but he kept going.
P4	Along came a hyena.@@"Hello, who are you?" asked the donkey.@@"Hello, I am hungry. I will eat you," replied the hyena.
P5	"I stood on a thorn, it could get stuck in your throat," said the donkey. @@"I will remove the thorn, then eat you," proposed the hyena.
P6	The hyena removed the thorn from the donkey's hoof. @@The donkey swiftly kicked the hyena in the head.@@The hyena ran away, yelping.
P7	The donkey returned home.@@The farmer came back from the market. @@He was surprised to find his donkey grazing outside.
