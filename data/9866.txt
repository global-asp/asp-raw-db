One day,  when Vicky was at school breaking up for her holidays,  Liz visited her at school and gave her the good news about their visit at the World Life Education Center. Vicky was very excited that she hugged Liz with joy. The following day,  Vicky packed her things she needed for camping. They boarded a bus to World Life Education Center. When they reached there,  they saw wonderful things like monkeys,  gorillas,  lions,  snakes and so many others. Since that,  Vicky realized how wonderful that holiday was with Liz! THE END.
