desc:	Three sisters go to the forest in search of firewood

page_text:

P1	There were many snakes near Nyare village. The biggest was Lego. It swallowed whole goats and sheep.
P2	One day,  Apiyo,  Ajoh and Atieno went to fetch firewood. Grandmother said,  "Be careful of Lego. Fetch firewood only." Ajoh did not pay attention.
P3	The girls packed some food,  ropes and a sharp machete. Apiyo said,  "I am the oldest,  so you must listen to me."
P4	They talked and laughed as they walked. Suddenly,  Apiyo said,  "Be quiet. We are near where Lego lives."
P5	Atieno said,  "These are Lego's golden teeth. Let us take them." Apiyo reminded them,  "Remember what grandmother told us. We must fetch only firewood."
P6	Ajoh said,  "Grandmother does not know anything. I will take the golden teeth." Apiyo and Atieno were not happy.
P7	Lego came looking for his golden teeth. They were not there. Lego thought,  "The one who took my teeth will know who I am!"
P8	On their way home,  the girls heard,  "Hzzzzzzzz!" Lego was there with his mouth wide open,  ready to bite.
P9	Lego asked,  "Who took my golden teeth?" No one answered. Lego said,  "The innocent girl will sing well. The thief will not."
P10	Apiyo sang:             It's not me! It's not me who took the teeth! The one who took is near! Atieno also sang well.
P11	Ajoh sang badly and the words did not come out. Lego shouted,  "Sing like the others." Lego knew that Ajoh took his golden teeth.
P12	Lego swallowed Ajoh. Her sisters ran home to say what happened. The girls' grandmother said sadly,  "I warned them,  if only Ajoh had listened."
