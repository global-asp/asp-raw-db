page_text:

P1	Long ago, there was a husband and wife called Yihdego and Tiebe. 

During a drought, Yihdego left home to find a job. At that time, Tiebe was pregnant with their second child.
P2	After staying away for a long time, Yihdego decided to return to his home. 

Before starting his journey, he went to a wise old man for advice.
P3	After Yihdego greeted the old man, he said, "I have been away from my home and family for a long time. Now I want to go back. I need your blessing and advice."
P4	"Listen my son, on your journey home, do not use a shortcut. Do not comment on everything you see. Do not make a decision while you are angry," advised the old man.
P5	Yihdego set off on his journey. He met four merchants. They came to a cross-road. 

The merchants chose to go the short way. Yihdego remembered the old man's advice. He went the long way. 

The merchants who went the short way were robbed by bandits.
P6	After travelling the whole day, Yihdego arrived at a village. He asked many households if he could stay the night, but all refused. 

A man told him, "We don't allow strangers to stay in our houses, but ask over there." He pointed to a house.
P7	It was the king's house. Many did not leave this house alive. Yihdego went there.

He was allowed to enter and was served fine food and drinks. 

The wife of the king was very beautiful.
P8	When he saw the house, Yihdego was inspired to ask, "How did you build this house?" He also wanted to say, "What a beautiful wife the king has!" 

But he remembered what the old man had advised him, and he kept quiet the whole night.
P9	The next morning when Yihdego was leaving, the king called him.

"Everyone who visits my house makes comments about it, and about my wife. You did not, you must be sent by God. Therefore, I will give you gold, grain and mules," said the king.
P10	After many days, Yihdego arrived at home. He knocked on the door, but no one opened it. 

He looked through the keyhole of the door. His wife was sleeping with two young men! He wanted to kill them but he remembered the old man's advice.
P11	The old man had told Yihdego, "Don't make a decision while you are angry."

Moments later, Tiebe opened the door and found her husband there. 

"Come and meet your father," she said to their two sons. They were happily re-united.
P12	Yihdego, with the help of the old man's advice, escaped robbery and murder and become rich. He lived happily with his family.
