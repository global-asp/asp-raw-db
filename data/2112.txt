page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a female giant. As she was walking near the lake one day,  she met three little girls.    The giant asked the girls,  "Who among you is loved by both parents?"
P2	One of the girls said,  "My mother loves me most." Another said,  "My father loves me most." But the third one said,  "I am loved by both parents."
P3	The giant asked the girl loved by both parents to help her carry firewood. So the girl followed the giant.
P4	They walked for some distance. The girl asked the giant,  "Where is your firewood?" The giant replied,  "It is near those trees over there!"
P5	When they reached the trees,  the girl asked again,  "Where is your firewood?" The giant answered,  "Not far now!"
P6	They met a man along the way. He asked the giant,  "What is the name of your child?" The giant replied,  "She is called the talking bag."
P7	The girl burst out singing. She sang,  "I am not called the talking bag. My name is Kaamungei! Oh! My mother,  whom I love. Oh! My father,  whom I love. Oh! My calabash,  which I use to drink milk!"
P8	When the man heard what the girl sang,  he rescued her and took her back to her parents.   The story ends there!
