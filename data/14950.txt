desc:	A rabbit with horns?! What is rabbit up to this time?

page_text:

P1	One day,  the animals with horns had a party. Only animals with horns were invited. The rabbit was sad. He was very fond of parties. "Could we make some horns?" the rabbit asked the monkey. The monkey had a very good idea.
P2	They found some horns. The monkey stuck the horns n the head of the rabbit. The rabbit looked very funny. "They look like real horns!" said the rabbit happily.
P3	The rabbit went to the party. The animals let him in because he had horns. Rabbit soon began to dance. He was so excited. Everyone was having a great time. They all laughed at the graces and skills of the rabbit.
P4	With the heat and sweat,  the glue that held the horns began to melt. Oh! What a a disgrace! The horns fell off the rabbit. The animals with horns stopped and looked. They were very angry.
P5	"Imposter! Trickster! Liar!" screamed some of the animals with horns. "Leave our party. Do not come back here!" Shouted others.
P6	The rabbit was very sad and embarrassed. He left the party. The animals with horns were angry. They shared their anger. Then the impala said,  "Let's not talk any more of that rascal. We will continue with our party,  which was so exciting!"
P7	The problem was that,  without the joy of the rabbit,  the animals with horns could not bring the party to life. Without the graces and skills of the rabbit,  the party was no fun. The kudu said,  "What a pity the rabbit does not have horns."
P8	Other animals with horns agreed,  "The party was much more exciting with the rabbit." "Why not invite the rabbit to the party?" asked the impala. "He does not have horns," said the buffalo. "And why did you have to have horns?" asked the rhino.
P9	"Let's have a party for animals with horns and without horns. It will be much more fun," they all agreed.  They called the rabbit,  "Come back to the party,  please. Without you the party has no spirit." Rabbit quickly accepted. He loves to party!
