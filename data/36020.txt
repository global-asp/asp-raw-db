P3	Your adapted text@  My crocodile, Horrible Jatau,@  has been with me since I was born. He likes eating all the soldiers in my@  body that fight germs and stop me from getting sick. When he eats too many of@  my soldiers, I get very sick. Then I cannot go to school and play with my@  friends.
