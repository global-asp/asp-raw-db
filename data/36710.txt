page_text:

P1	It was the 1st of  March and I was so excited because it was me and my Mom's birthday month , on the same day it was my Uncle's birthday. I was all hyped up knowing my birthday is in 2 weeks time.
P2	One week later I was counting down cause my birthday is on the 14 of March  .We heard stories that there is a pandemic discovered in China , Wuhan. This pandemic is called CORONAVIRUS. It was discovered in 2019 , December therefore it is called COVID-19.The second continent to get was Europe. So we did not think it was ever going to touch Africa.Well this was only the beginning.
P3	It sounded like a story that would never come true . Well my birthday passed , at that time I was turning  10 years old. COVID had already hit Africa and South Africa. The first case in South Africa was discovered in Kwazulu-Natal ,Durban.
P4	On the 26 of MARCH the President declared a stage 5 nation-wide lockdown as COVID-19 was getting  out of  hand. The rules were 1.5-2meters social distancing ,wear a mask ,sanitizing or washing hands frequently ,go to the shops only for essential shopping. But some people seemed not to understand those rules. In my mind I always asked myself that what's important  being stubborn or protecting your life and health.
P5	Lets not even mention the schools closing due to the protocols , we had to stay at home for more than a month until until May when we started online schooling like google classroom. I missed going on movie dates with my Mom and ice-cream dates with my Dad.
P6	My Mom and Dad worked from home .They had so so many meetings .I did my school work in my       pyjamas :),that was the nice thing about working from home. In the early days of April it was Easter. I usually  had sleepovers with my cousins but because of  COVID  we could not do it ,so instead we cooked pickled fish with hot cross buns . I cooked a lot during lockdown, infact I learned most cooking during lockdown from this recipe book called lazy makoti .
P7	It was finally May and my first sibling was on the way and I was so excited . It was a boy and his name is Likhona. He is so adorable. We used to watch Netflix together but now he can crawl and drives me  so crazy .May passed and it was June , June is my Dad's birthday month and also Fathers day month .For me it is a tradition to watch a show called Sarafina . It plays on SABC 3 or E.TV.
P8	On the 16 of June was my Dad's birthday and it was also youth day . On the same day my brother was turning exactly 2 weeks since he was born on the 26 of May and remember that show I was telling you about I also watched it so it was all a bonus day . Oh and I forgot we also had a braai, extra bonus :) .
P9	It was so hard in deep lockdown but  at least now it is level 1 we go back to school and we travel safely . Plus it is a new year, new life and we see our friends .So that was my story I could write about lockdown, thank you for reading my story and bye bye 2020 hello 2021 :).
