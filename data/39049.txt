page_text:

P1	"Let me tell you about my school." You'll hear meows, bleats, neighs, barks and clucks too.
P2	Chicky Licky wakes us up bright and early with his cock-a-doodle-do.
P3	On the way, he meets Kitty Cat for a quick chit chat. And off they go to find Patch Patch.
P4	Before they arrive for the first lesson of the day, Hillary Horse gallops their way and off they go to learn and later they play.
P5	As evening sets in, they gather for a scrumptious supper of warm bread and mielies on the cob.
P6	Just in time for bed, they moon watch from the kraal.
P7	Together they sing a goodnight song to give thanks for the day that's passed.
