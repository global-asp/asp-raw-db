P2	Well,  can l have your new red coat? Said Anna. Don't be silly,  said her Mum I will think of something you can take. Anna cried and cried I want a hat,  or a dress,  or a red coat,  she said. Mum was cross Your are very silly,  said Mum. I have told you Anna. You can not have my hat,  or a dress,  or a red coat. Now it is bedtime.
P3	The next morning Anna ran down for breakfast. Have you got something for me Mum? Said Anna. Yes. It is in this box. You can open it at school. Anna went to school She took the box with her. It was too small to have a dress in it. It was too big to have a hat in it.
