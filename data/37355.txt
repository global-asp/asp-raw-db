page_text:

P1	There was once a little boy who had so much to tell. He thought about anything and everything there was to think of.
P2	He thought about what bugs eat, how the morning occurs, how dark it is inside the stomach of an elephant, how exactly does his reflection occur in the mirror.
P3	He thought of so many things, and had so much to tell others but, the only problem was that he was too shy to speak to others.
P4	His mom told him that she was really shy too, and still is at times. One of the bravest things she does to this day is stand up and speak infront of others. So even though he felt shy, he decided to be brave.
