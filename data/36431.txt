P1	And one day suddenly we got an unexpected partner in all the mandatory crime..!!
P2	Not participating togather and judging others..!! üôàüòÅüòÅ Don't you think we USED to do..!!
P3	The motivational lectures after a team fight, Hating the same person together. I miss us and I realised it today..!!
P4	When silence doesn't make you connect, word would never be able to..!! And you heard the sound of my silence which touched my soul..!! Bless you ‚ù£Ô∏è
