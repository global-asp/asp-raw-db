page_text:

P1	Once upon a time , there lived a kingdom in the heart of the jungle in the far Eastern part of Africa. The ruler of the kingdom was king Leopard.The king was known in the whole jungle for his wisdom and kindness.
P2	The king called the animals for a meeting. They all came eagerly waiting to hear what the king had called them for.
P3	The king informed them that there would be Javelin Throwing competition. Elephant stood and stomped anxiously. The king listened to his opinion. The elephant suggested that they could have a tree breaking day. The animals disliked the idea.
P4	Since majority wins, they went on with the king's idea. The Elephant went back and sat down sadly. The king showed the animals the javelin.
P5	The antelope decided to go first. The animals cheered him happily.
P6	The antelope threw it with all her might. The animals clapped for her as she went back.
P7	Next participant was the gorilla. He was overconfident with himself. He jumped up high and threw it away.
P8	It was time for the elephant. He was anxious but he managed to throw it.
P9	Warthog went next. The fact that he was ugly made the animals to laugh at him. That diminished his hopes. However, he composed himself and with all his might he lept forward and threw. Elephant looked back afraid to see him being defeated.
P10	It was time to announce the results of the game. The king called out for the antelope. The antelope came up and bowed down to the king as a sign of honour.
P11	The king then declared him as the winner. The animals looked at him in disbelief. Some, envied him. The award for the winner of the game was to be the next king after leopard retires. And antelope would be that king.
