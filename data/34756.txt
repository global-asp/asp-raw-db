page_text:

P1	Lizzy lived next to a busy road. She would often sit outside and watch the activities of the street. @@Full taxis carried people to work. Children passed on their way to school, and runners jogged past in the evenings.
P2	Lizzy also liked to watch the insects as they crawled and flew around the yard. @@Sometimes Lizzy nibbled on the sour flowers that grew under the tap at the back of her house.
P3	One day, Lizzy saw two girls on the other side of the road. They wanted to cross and were holding hands for safety. @@Mamma always told Lizzy, "Before you cross any road, look left, look right, look left again. Check it's safe to go."
P4	Finally, there was a gap between the cars. The one girl sprinted across, leaving the other who was hesitating. @@"Come on Mosa, quickly before the next car!" shouted the girl who had crossed. Mosa jumped forward without checking.
P5	Lizzy watched with big eyes as the blaring of a car hooter reached her ears.@ @"DOOFF!" the car catapulted Mosa into the air.  She landed on the sidewalk near Lizzy's house.
P6	Lizzy's eyes got even bigger and her jaw dropped.  She darted into the house.  @@"Mamma! Mamma! A girl has been bumped by a car!  She is lying outside of our yard and she is not moving!" cried Lizzy.
P7	Mamma rushed outside. She saw Mosa, and quickly called an ambulance. @@People began to  gather around Mosa, who lay unconscious. @@Soon, the sound of an ambulance siren filled the air.@"Whee whoo, whee whoo!"
P8	The worried paramedics placed Mosa carefully on a stretcher, and took her to hospital. @@After Mosa's accident, the local schools introduced road safety lessons for parents and children.@@The community petitioned for a pedestrian crossing, so that no more children would be hurt.
