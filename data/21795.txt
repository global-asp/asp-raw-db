desc:	Two men are advised wrongly by a judge. They seek the wisdom of the elders and live happily afterwards.

page_text:

P1	Kombe and Juma were poor neighbours. 

They did everything for themselves.
P2	They wished they had a donkey. 

He would carry their things.
P3	Kombe said, “Let us buy a donkey together.” 

They were happy.
P4	When Kombe’s father died, Kombe became rich. 

He forgot Juma.
P5	Kombe wanted donkey meat for his dogs. 

Juma needed the donkey.
P6	The judge said, “Each of you can take half the donkey.”
P7	Kombe killed the donkey. 

Juma carried things for himself once again.
P8	Kombe wanted to burn his hut and build a new one.
P9	Juma said, “Mine will burn too.” 

The judge agreed with Kombe.
P10	Juma’s hut burned. 

The judge said, “Kombe burned only his hut.”
P11	Juma had no donkey, no hut. He slept under the tree.
P12	Juma worked hard. He had a good crop of peas.
P13	Kombe’s boys ate most of the peas from Juma’s land.
P14	The boys said, “Ask our father to pay for your peas.”
P15	Juma said, “I don’t want your money. I want my peas.”
P16	The judge told Juma, “Cut the boys open. Take your peas.”
P17	Juma refused to listen. Kombe cried, “Let the elders decide.”
P18	The elders said, “You killed the donkey. You burned his hut.”
P19	They said to Juma, “Killing Kombe’s sons is wrong too.”
P20	Kombe gave Juma half of his property. 

They lived happily.
