P1	*SECTION* — SHAPES INSIDE SHAPES@@Prerequisite: Curiosity and persistence to find patterns involving shapes@@INVESTIGATION — BOUNCING BILLIARD BALL@@Imagine a billiard table that has a pocket in each of the four corners. When a ball bounces off the side of the table, it bounces away at the same angle it came in at. This investigation looks at the question: If we shoot a ball at a 45 degree angle from one corner, where will it end up? The answer depends on the size of the table. This is what happens on a 3 by 4 table.
P2	Challenge your child to predict what the answer is in advance — which corner will be hit first and how many bounces will it take?@@INVESTIGATION — FILLING REGIONS WITH SHAPES@@Suppose you have an 8 by 8 chessboard and you have a collection of 1 by 2 tiles. Finding a way to exactly cover the chessboard with 32 of these 1 by 2 tiles is simple enough. @@Let's start playing around with removing squares from the chessboard. If you remove one corner of the chessboard, you know immediately that you can no longer cover the chessboard with tiles because the tiles will cover an even number of squares, and there are now 63 squares. Okay, remove two corners to make an even number of remaining squares - can you cover it now? The answer depends on which two corners you remove. Why? What if you no longer restrict yourself to removing corners, what happens?
P3	One important lesson in dealing with questions like these is to learn from playing with smaller problems. Try these questions on a 4 by 4 or 6 by 6 board first.@@If your child is enjoying these questions, start branching out to using other shapes to fill the board. Play around with filling it with 1 by 3 tiles or with 3 squares in an L shape. What patterns and rules do you discover with these? What other shapes might be interesting to play with?@@INVESTIGATION — FILLING SQUARES WITH SQUARES@@In which ways can you fill a square with other squares, where the other squares need not all be the same size? However, the side length of each square must be some whole number multiple of a fixed length. The question to investigate is: What are all the numbers of squares that are possible? If you know a number is possible, is there an easy way to describe how to do it?
P4	Let your child play with it over many days and don't be in a hurry to get to the answer. Here is a diagram showing how 6 is possible.@@If your child enjoys exploring that question, explore variations on this theme. Suppose you only allow squares of certain sizes — such as 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and 3 by 3. Another direction to look at is  filling other figures with figures that have the same shape. For example, ask the same question for regular triangles (triangles with all their sides the same length). Some figures are interesting to investigate in this way, and some are not interesting at all - which ones?
P5	*SECTION* — MULTIPLYING AND MULTIPLES@@Prerequisite: Comfort multiplying single-digit numbers and skip counting to 100@@GAME — THE PRODUCT GAME@@Use a shared piece of paper filled out as follows: The first player moves a token onto any number from 1 to 9 in the 1-9 squares. The second player puts another token on one of the 1-9 squares and claims the product in the 6 by 6 grid. From then on, each player chooses to move either of the two tokens and claims the product (if they can). The first player to claim 3 squares in a row wins.@@Mix up the product numbers to give your child better practice identifying the products. See the Chapter 5 Bonus Material for designs of larger boards with larger ranges.
P6	PUZZLE — ISLAND HOPPING WITH PRODUCTS@@These puzzles have islands (circles and squares) connected by bridges (lines). If there are two circles on either side of a square, then the square holds the product of the two circles. The challenge is to fill in the missing numbers.@@Make these puzzles by filling in the circles, then filling in the squares, and finally removing some of the numbers before giving it to your child.@@In addition to practicing multiplication, these puzzles can be structured to practice common factors as well. In the first puzzle, the only number, other than 1, that divides 14 and 21 is 7, so that is the number in the bottom circle.
P7	GAME — CHECKERS MATH@@Each player has 10 counters. The counters are numbered from 1 to 10, with the "10" counter marked with 10 and 11. The counters start on the end rows of a 100-chart — one player on squares 1 to 10 and the other on squares 91 to 100.@@Initially, counters can only move "forward" one row onto any multiple of the number(s) on the marker they choose — for the player starting on 1 to 10, forward means larger numbers, and for the player starting on 91 to 100, forward means smaller numbers. Once a counter has made it all the way across the board, it becomes a king and can move forward or backward one row after that. An opponent's piece is taken by landing on it. A player's piece cannot double up with another of the same player's pieces. You win by taking all your opponent's pieces. For younger players, shorten the board to use the first 6 rows — the numbers from 1 to 60.
P8	*SECTION* — ADD, SUBTRACT, AND MULTIPLY@@Prerequisite: Comfort with two-digit addition and subtraction, and one-digit multiplication@@GAME — COUNTING NEIGHBORS@@Use three dice and an 8 by 8 board of numbers from 1 to 64. A player rolls the dice and uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to make any unmarked number on the board. The player marks this square and receives one point for the square plus one more point for each marked square that it touches, including diagonally. If a player cannot make a play, any other player who finds a play can claim that score. Play five or more rounds, with the largest score winning.@@Some game options are to use a fourth die, and to use a smaller or larger board.
P9	PUZZLE — MAKING A MOBILE@@You are given some weights and a design for a mobile that has some attach points. The challenge is to put at most one weight per attach point so the mobile will balance along every arm. Assume the wires are weightless. Each arm in the mobile is a lever that needs balancing, so these puzzles are an extension of the Lever Balance puzzle given earlier in this chapter - practice those puzzles before starting these.@@Start with the simplest mobiles, which are just levers in the air. Here is a solution for putting the weights from 1 to 4 on this mobile to balance it. This works because 2 x 4 + 1 x 2 = 4 x 1 + 3 x 2.
P10	Here is a more complicated mobile. The two bottom wires are each balanced as before. The top wire is balanced using the total of the weights below it. To balance each side of the top wire (1 + 3) x 3 = (4 + 2) x 2. Go to the Chapter 5 Bonus Material for more examples and a longer discussion of mobiles.@@PUZZLE — LIMITED CALCULATORS@@The premise is that you have a calculator that is badly broken and you are challenged to produce some result on the calculator. This is easy to play orally whenever you have a spare moment. The following are some examples to get you started.
P11	Suppose you had a calculator with +, -, x, and /, but only one working number key, the 4. Could you get the result 21? If so, what is the fewest number of steps you would need? Suppose you could use 4 at most four times — which numbers could you produce? Suppose you had to use the 4 exactly four times. Play around with having other single keys and creating other results.@@Suppose your calculator could only add 4 or 7. Which numbers could you produce? Suppose it had 4 or 7, but now it can add and subtract. Which numbers could you produce? This is the same activity we've seen in other settings.@@Suppose you only had a 1 key and could only add or double. For example, 2 x (2 x 1) + 1 is 5. What other numbers can you create?
P12	*SECTION* — FACTORS COUNT@@Prerequisite: Can multiply single-digit numbers and getting better at factoring numbers@@GAME — GRABBING FACTORS@@Use a 4 by 6 grid of numbers from 1 to 24. On a turn, a player chooses a number that is uncovered and has at least one factor uncovered — the player gets the selected number and the other player gets any or all of the uncovered factors (they choose which ones). Play alternates until no legal numbers are left. The players add up their numbers and the higher sum wins.@@Taxman is a solitaire version where the player selects each number and the taxman gets all the available factors. Play continues until the player no longer has a legal move — at that point, the taxman receives the remaining numbers. The goal is to have as large a sum as possible — bigger than the taxman if possible.@@Let the number range suit the players — 1 to 12 or even 1 to 60.
P13	GAME — DOUBLE OR NOTHING@@Players start the game by secretly picking 5 distinct numbers larger than 20 and not bigger than 120. These are then written where all can see.@@Using Number Cards or some other device, create a random number from 1 to 20. That number is repeatedly doubled until either someone's number is hit or the number becomes bigger than 120. The first player to have all five numbers hit is the winner. @@With experience, your child will develop strategies for selecting their five numbers. One simple strategy is that it is a bad idea to pick a number, such as 46, that is not a power of 2 times some number between 1 and 20 — it will never get hit. Some numbers with lots of factors of 2, such as 32, are more likely to be hit because more starting numbers can get to them.@@For younger players, select numbers above 10 and not above 60, and select a random number from 1 to 10.
P14	GAME — FACTOR WAR@@Have two sets of cards, say from 1 to 25. Play the standard game of war with these, only now the winner is the card that has more factors. For example, 12 beats 16 because 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12) while 16 has 5 factors (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16). The holder of the winning card must be able to correctly list the factors to win the cards — otherwise, the cards get shuffled back into each player's draw pile. As with standard War, when there is a tie, then next cards are turned over and the winner receives all the cards.@@There are several possible variations for you to play around with. You can play that the smaller number of factors wins. You can count the total of just the prime factors rather than all the factors. You can play that prime powers (numbers that are a power of a prime) beat other numbers.
P15	*SECTION* — INTERESTING PRODUCTS@@Prerequisite: single-digit multiplication and skip counting@@GAME — MULTIPLICATION BINGO@@Each player starts with a 4 by 4 grid of numbers that are possible multiplication products — these numbers can either be randomly assigned or carefully chosen by the player.@@To start, two cards are dealt and put face up on the table. If either player has the product of those two numbers, they cover it. From then on, the players take turns taking the top card from the draw pile and choosing which of the two cards to replace. All players who have a match with the product cover it. The first player to get 4 in a row wins.
P16	GAME — CROSSING THE VOLCANO@@Use a 100-chart with the 36 squares on the four edges colored gray. Use playing cards with picture cards removed or use Number Cards from 1 to 10.@@On a turn, if you pick a 1 you can claim any odd number; if you pick any other number, you can claim any multiple of it. If you claim a number, your opponent cannot claim it. The aim is to make a path from one edge to the opposite edge, in either direction. You do not need to claim the squares in the order of your path.@@You can either play that diagonal connections are okay or not okay. Another option is to include picture cards — if you get one of these, you can put in a blocked square that cannot be included in either person's path.
P17	PUZZLE — CROSS PRODUCTS@@This multiplication puzzle is either 3 by 3 involving each of the numbers 1 to 6 exactly once, or 4 by 4 involving the numbers 1 to 8 exactly once. The challenge is to fill in some of the squares, two numbers for each row and each column, so that the product of a row is the number marked to the far right and the product of the column is the number marked below the column. Some rows or columns may not be marked — if so, there is no constraint on the product of those rows or columns.@@Solve by finding columns and rows where you can identify the two numbers. The 30 column must have 5 and 6, and the 10 row must have 2 and 5. Next, the 12 column must have 3 and 4 and the 4 row must have 1 and 4. The rest follows quickly.
P18	As is often the case with these puzzles, the adult can make them by filling in the numbers on the inside of the puzzle first, writing down the products, and then removing all the interior numbers.
