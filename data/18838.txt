page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived Mr Monkey and Mr Lizard.
P2	One day,  Mr Lizard asked Mr Monkey to go for a dance. Mr Monkey accepted the invitation and met Mr Lizard in town.
P3	When the two friends met,  Mr Lizard and his lizard friends surrounded Mr Monkey and wrapped him in banana leaves until he could no longer see anything.
P4	"Where are you taking me! What is happening?"  cried Mr Monkey. Mr Lizard did not answer but secretly he was planning to slaughter and eat Mr Monkey.
P5	The lizards took turns carrying Mr Monkey back to Mr Lizard's home. Every few minutes they would switch who was carrying Mr Monkey.
P6	At first,  they were very careful to not let Mr Monkey escape but as time went on Mr Monkey began to look very sleepy and tired. Because of this,  the lizards became less careful about watching Mr Monkey.
P7	At one point the lizards stopped for a rest and put Mr Monkey down. The lizards were having a very serious conversation and stopped watching Mr Monkey. Mr Monkey suddenly jumped up and ran very fast,  all the banana leaves still wrapped around him.
P8	The lizards tried to chase him but he was too quick. When Mr Monkey reached home he took the banana leaves off his back and put them on the ground for his young ones to sleep on. He slept very well that night.
P9	The lizards blamed themselves for becoming lazy and letting Mr Monkey Escape.
