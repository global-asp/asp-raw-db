page_text:

P1	I finish my hot,  hot bath. My wet body feels so cool,  cool,  cool.  What makes that happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P2	The milk in my cup is too hot. But soon it is ready for me to sip. Who makes that happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P3	The window curtains flutter and gently brush my face. Who makes it happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P4	A bolt of lightning far away. Black clouds moving my way. Who makes that happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P5	Branches sway and leaves tremble. Flowers gently fall. Who did it all? Vayu,  the wind!
P6	We are playing far from the house. Yet I can smell the food mother is preparing. Who makes it happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P7	A glass on a windowsill,  crashes to the ground. I am glad I was not around. Who broke the glass? It was Vayu,  the wind!
P8	A whistle blows. A train rolls in. I cannot see it,  but I hear its din. Who makes that happen? Vayu,  the wind!
P9	Cannot be seen. Cannot be heard. Works without saying a word. Who can it be? Of course! The wind.
