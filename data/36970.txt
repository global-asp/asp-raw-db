page_text:

P1	Chapter 1 - Nearly.@@My breath is heavy with the weight of my actions, and as the sun rises cowardly in the east, a thought dawns on me. What did I just do? Walking towards the only door for miles, I enter the moth filled cabin.
P2	The smell of decades of dust and the iron scent of fresh blood lace the air, combining together to contaminate the air with an unpleasant stench.
P3	My uniform cries, petite glimmering teardrops transfiguring into a translucent puddle around my near white shoes while my hair sends small rivers down my back that creep slowly towards the splintering wooden floor.
P4	I glance at the sports bag and pompoms I discarded in my haste earlier, wondering if I should make another trip to the lake.
P5	One look at the eerily silent face lying still on the creaking iron bunk bed changed my mind swiftly. There were more important things to be done anyway.
P6	As I gather my things and head to my moonlight toned Jeep, the sun sends a warning glow with its sunset haze flush against my face.
