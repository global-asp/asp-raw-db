page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a father who had two sons.
P2	One day,  he called his sons and said,  "I am old and will die soon. But before I die,  I want to see you in your own homes. You have one month to each make your own home. I want to see you back here after the month."
P3	The two sons rushed out. The first one went to the roadside. He cut down trees and began to build a big compound for himself.
P4	The second one,  however,  went out and started forming special relationships with other families. He went to different people,  and he became like their foster child.
P5	After a month,  the two brothers came back to their father. The father said,  "Well,  have you built your homes?" And both of the brothers said,  "Yes."
P6	The father went with his eldest son. He saw that the son had built many huts. As he walked by each hut,  he asked,  "Is there anybody in this hut?" Each time,  the son replied,  "No."
P7	The father would ask,  "Is there anybody in this hut?" And the son would reply,  "No."
P8	The father became hungry,  but there was no one to serve food to him. He said,  "Let's go home." So they went home.
P9	The second brother took them to the first family he had adopted. He introduced them,  "Here is my father and my brother." The family welcomed the men. They slaughtered a sheep and gave them a big feast.
P10	They went to the second family the younger son had adopted. He introduced his father and brother and they were given another feast.
P11	Father and brother were welcomed in all the places where the younger son was adopted. They ate and were satisfied. Then they left for home.
P12	The father said,  "This is what I meant when I said you should make yourself a home. A home is more than many huts or a big expensive house. It is love,  warmth and friendship with other people."
