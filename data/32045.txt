page_text:

P1	There is a boy named Rodney. He lives with his family. @@His mother and father are Jamima and Mike. His sisters are Suzy and Lola. @@Rodney is the last born child.
P2	Rodney loves playing chess. @@He loves it so much that whenever he plays chess, he does not talk.
P3	One day, when Rodney was at school playing chess, he realised that the game could be about his family.
P4	Mike is the King. @@Jamima is the queen, which is why she has power. @@Suzy and Lola are the knights and bishops. @@Rodney is the pawn because he is younger.
P5	After realising this, Rodney ran home to tell his family.
P6	They all laughed at him at first. But later they understood. @@Rodney explained their roles and why he is a pawn.
P7	Rodney told his mom that she is the queen, and his father a king. @@His sisters are knights and bishops.
P8	Rodney is a pawn because he likes adventure! @@He can become anything he wants, even if he has to make some sacrifices.
