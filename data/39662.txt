P1	Once upon a time, there lived a Hunter from Mariene village.He lived with his wife, Mwonjiru and his son Gatobu.
P2	They had no food to eat, so he decided to go to hunt for food. He walked desperately through a narrow path leading to the forest.
P3	After a long  cumbersome journey, he met a giraffe tied on a tree. He was very happy because he would have something to feed his family.
P4	He thought for a while of what to do with the giraffe.
P5	Using his spear, he decided to cut the rope from where it had been tied.
P6	After cutting, the giraffe kicked the hunter away and left him sprawling on the ground.
P7	He tried to grab the giraffe's tail to stop it from running but it was too powerful for him. At a speed of lightening the giraffe took off.
P8	The hunter returned home feeling dejected and frustrated wondering what to take home for his family. How unlucky he was!
