page_text:

P1	Once there was a girl name Latoya. Latoya lived in a small village with her mother and father. Her grandmother took her to church every Sunday and most days her grandmother would read the bible with her. Latoya's grandmother taught her how to pray and the older she grew the more she loved going to church.
P2	A few years had passed by and sadly her grandmother passed away. This broke Latoya's heart, but she found comfort in GOD. She continued going to church and would often beg her mom and dad to join her.
P3	They kids in her village would often make fun of her for going to church and for praying. The called her names like, "The church girl" "Miss Holy."
P4	Latoya prayed for her friends, her family and those who mocked her. She asked GOD to work through her to show them the unconditional love they would receive from GOD. The same kids who mocked her were destroying their lives by smoking and drinking alcohol.
P5	Latoya's mom never believed in GOD and often told her that she was wasting her time there is no GOD. She would just smile at her mom and say, Mom GOD loves you.
P6	Every Sunday she would ask her mom and dad to go to church with her and every Sunday they would turn her down.
P7	Latoya's mom drank daily to a point where she became very sick, her liver started giving in and she landed up in hospital.
P8	A month later her mom was released from hospital. Soon she felt better and started drinking again.
P9	Latoya pleaded with her mom to stop drinking or she would die. Her mom continued drinking and her condition got worse she was now in need of a total liver transplant. They knew if they don't find a donor her mom would die.
P10	Latoya prayed and by the grace of GOD they found a donor. Her mother had a successful liver transplant and was thankful to GOD for saving her life, since that day her mom changed her life and started going to church.  She is now known as Pastor Lydia, Latoya is the worship leader and her dad is an Usher. They are all active in church and lead much happier lives.
