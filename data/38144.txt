page_text:

P1	Itâ€™s the last day of vacation in Afe Babalola university and itâ€™s sunny. Aliyu is complaining about  how stressful Abuad is, he was lied to that Abuad is a really fun school by his cousin Moremi ðŸ˜‚. The stress is just too much for him.
P2	Aliyu was supposed to go home on a Friday but his cousin Moremi had an exam on Thursday and her dad made her come home that Thursday. Aliyu following Moremi home that Thursday had to start parking his load in a rush but this made Moremi sad
P3	Moremi was sad because she had to leave the love of her life Buba behind in school and it also made Buba also sad. Buba got angry at Moremi because he didnâ€™t know how to take that information having staying back because of his one true love
P4	But with time Buba came to understand Moremi wasnâ€™t at fault and he had to maximize the time he had left with his baby girl. Then on that fateful vacation day Buba came to see his one true love, Moremi.
P5	Aliyu being at the gate for over thirty minutes was already running out of patience as his cousin was dealing with some missing luggage and Buba was also sad that she had to go through that to go home but Buba stayed with her through that.
P6	Luckily Moremi found her luggage and Buba felt so happy for her but also sad she had to leave him behind but Aliyu was so happy he got to go home ðŸ˜‚. Buba watched Moremi go with regrets he couldnâ€™t get to tell her how much he loved her ðŸ¤§
P7	Then Buba went back to hostel, packed his things and left school also. Then he called his one true love that night and had a very sexy conversation with her that night ðŸ™ƒ. Buba slept thinking of how privileged he was to have the most caring
P8	woman in the world. As time passed Aliyu now went to the Market and Buba grew so much love for Moremi @And heâ€™s sworn to love her to the end of the world. I love you Moremi and Iâ€™ll always do even if you donâ€™t ðŸ¥º
