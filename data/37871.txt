P1	Once in a far away country there lived a cruel king named Sinanda.He ruled one of the villages in the country.The village was called Songambele.While he was on his first year of ruling,acted fairly and was friendly to the villagers.
P2	When his days of ruling went by,he started acting cruely.His people began to complain about him.He wasted a lot of time on enjoying himself with his cruel friends,and as you know,time wasted is not recovered.
P3	After years later,drought strikes the whole village.People started dying of hunger because nobody was there to feed them.
P4	People  were suffering while he was enjoying  himself and was as happy as a lark.He began to misuse his power and authority.
P5	One good morning when the birds of air were singing their melodic tunes,the king woke up and drained the window so as to  feel the cool sea breeze.@Suddenly,an old woman came crying.Tears rolling her face like flowing water.

P7	The king  became angry also the way you know,a hungry man is always angry.The king did  not have his breakfast yet.@He went into his multrimomiun room and took his royal sword.
P8	Immediately he came back and ordered the guards to take the woman away.The  angry woman full of pain refused to get out.The king was left with no choice but to finish the woman
