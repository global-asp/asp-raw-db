page_text:

P1	Don was a big baboon. He was a bully.
P2	He was the baboon chief.
P3	His followers gave him a special cloth.
P4	"I will wear this on my head," said Don.
P5	"Everyone follow my orders. Do not question me!" shouted Don.
P6	So,  the followers followed their chief. If Don jumped,  everyone jumped.
P7	But the band on Don's head was too tight.
P8	He touched his sore head. The baboons touched their heads.
P9	"This hurts," said Don. "This hurts," they copied.
P10	"This is too tight!" "This is too tight," they copied.
P11	Don fell down,  over a cliff. They all copied him.
P12	The baboon chief died. His followers were hurt,  but they lived.
