page_text:

P1	WARNING BELL BEFORE THE TRAGEDY @in 1969, the UCIL factory was made to produce  sevin [ a pesticide ] using methyl isocyanate as an intermediate. In 1976, trade unions in Bhopal complained of pollution within the plant. A few years later,
P2	a worker accidentally inhaled a large amount of toxic phosgene gas, leading to his death a couple of hours later. Observing the events,a journalist began investigating the plant and also published his findings in Bhopal's local paper,
P3	saying - 'Wake up people of Bhopal, you are on the edge of a volcano'. Two years before tragedy struck Bhopal, around 45 workers who were exposed to phosenge were admitted to a hospital. Between 1983 and 1984 their were leaks of
P4	phosenge, carbon tetrachloride, methyl isocyanate and mono methylamine
P5	HOW METHYL ISOCYANTE LEAKED .@@ Union carbide's India's Bhopal facility housed three 68,000 litres liquid MIC tanks . The tanks were not allowed to be filled more than 50%.
P6	However one tank lost the ability to contain nitrogen gas pressure hence liquid MIC cannot be pumped out of it, As per the rules, each of the tanks could not be pumped with more than 30 tonnes of liquid MIC.
P7	But this tank was filled with 42 tonnes. This failure forced UCIL to halt methyl isocyanate production in bhopal and the plant was partially shutdown for maintenance. An attempt was made to make the falty tanks to work again on 1st december
P8	however the attempt failed . By then , most of the plant's methyl isocyanate related safety systems were malfunctioning. According to reports, by December 2 eve, water had entered the malfuntioning tank, which resulted in runaway chemical
P9	reaction. The pressure in the tank increased 5 times by night. By midnight, the workers in the MIC area started feeling the effects of MIC gas. The decision to address the leak was to be made a couple of mins later.
P10	However, by then  the chemical reaction in the tank had reached a critical state. About 30tonnes of MIC escaoed from the tanks into the atmosphere within an hour. Most bhopal residents were made aware of the gas leak by expousure to gasself
P11	IMPACT @Doctors were not aware of proper treatment methods the incident. Methyl isocyanate gas leak killed more than 15,000 people and affected over 600,000 workers. The city ran out of cremation grounds.
