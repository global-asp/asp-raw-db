P1	Ooh! It is yet another morning. My mother is preparing breakfast for us. Our father is preparing to go to work. My brothers and I are still in bed though awake.
P2	Time for work. My father is busy at his workplace. He works at a building site as the head architecture. He always says that he loves his job. Look at the workers on yellow helmets and green aprons.
P3	My brothers and I playing. It is our free time and our mother allows us to play whenever we are free. At times, we listen at the radio and compete dancing.
P4	It is now late in the evening and our parents are back at home. My father looks tired from the day's work. They are happy to find us safe at home.
P5	Today is on Sunday. We are all going to church. My brothers and I look smart. Our father is driving us in his car. On our way to church, we have a lot of fun and we laugh all the way to the church. After the church, we return home.
P6	Today is on a Monday. We are preparing to go for school. After a breakfast we now walk for school. Juma is walking slowly but we have to hurry or else we will be caned for being late by the teacher on duty.
P7	This is our school. It is called Bidii Bora Primary School. My teacher is called Mr Wabora. He teaches us science, Mathematics, Social studies and Science.
P8	It is break time, my friends and I are are at the field playing. We are playing football. The sun is shinning brightly in the sky. It is so hot and we are sweating as we are playing.
P9	We are on our way back home after school. My brother is playing a home-made ball. There is ten shillings I saved last Sunday and I pass to a kiosk to buy a Candy.I love Candy very much.
P10	On the following Saturday, our father takes us to the Game reserve. It turns to be a great day for us as we have a beautiful picnic in the Park. We see Lions, Zebras, Giraffes, Gazelles and Hyenas. The End.
