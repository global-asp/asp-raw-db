page_text:

P1	My first visit to the library was during March 2019 school holidays. I visited Soweto for the first time in my life.
P2	Because I visited Soweto for the first time , I decided to make friends with someone who knows the place better.
P3	The best friend I met was Thato.
P4	Thato likes reading. Therefore she frequently visited the local library to borrow books for free.
P5	One day Thato suggested that we must visit the local library together. Upon arrival since it was school holidays, the librarian invited us to join other kids in holiday reading programs organized by the library .
P6	The librarian gave us books to read in groups of five. Then after he gave us tablets to answer questions based on our stories.
P7	The librarian set us questions ever day for five days using a scavenger hunt App called Actionbound. My group answered more questions correctly. As a results we have scored more points than other groups.
P8	By scoring more points, the librarian declared us winners of '' March 2019, Digital Story telling and Reading Marathon''. Then we lined up together next to main entrance for a photo shoot.
P9	So our picture was posted on a big notice board labeled '' WALL OF FAME ''.
P10	Because our group won, lot of people from other groups wanted to be my friends!! I made lot of friends on that day. @@I have decided to join the library immediately to be a member so that I can also borrow books and read at home.
P11	Since my first visit to the library, I am always looking forward to come to Soweto during every school holidays.
P12	This is because the librarian told me that they implement these programs during every school holidays. @@So I will always come so that we can defend our title as '' Champions of the Digital Story telling and Reading Marathon ''
P13	Also to ensure that our picture remains on the notice board titled '' Wall of fame ''
