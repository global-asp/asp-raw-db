page_text:

P1	A long time ago, when the world was still young and people were still living in small villages, there was a woman in the village by the name of "Mazanendaba".
P2	Mazanendaba was living in a beautiful house by the river with her children and husband. She loved her family and tried by all means to teach her children all the skills she could including swimming. Swimming was their favorite.
P3	Mazanendaba'family would regularly take her family to the river to swim, splash and have good time chasing each other. They were also fishing regularly.
P4	Mazanendaba's husband, Zenzele was a sculpturer . He was a tall strong man specializing as a sculpturer.
P5	As a sculpturer, he used to carve birds, springbok or kudu drinking water from the river and many other artifacts from wood and use them to decorate their house until the house ran out of space to store artifacts.
P6	One day Mazanendaba was longing for olden days whereby they use sit around the fire listening stories and folklore. Her Husband, advised her to take a walk in the forest and maybe she could come across animals that could tell storie
P7	With lot of hope in her head, she set off to find some stories. The first animal that she met was the Hare, a well known trick star.
P8	He smiled a toothy smile and said :@"I know lots of stories. For instance I could tell a story about ehh.... . ehh....!!@I am sorry, I am in hurry!! Next time I see you I will tell you!!!
P9	Then she met a big mother Baboon, she stood clumsily in front of Mazanendaba and said :@@Ha! What are you saying? Are telling me that human children are more problematic than others? You give them a house to stay in, clothes to wear, food
P10	"You give them a house to stay, clothes wear, food to eat and on top of that they they still want stories? Hayi, I am lucky I am not a human mother!!?
P11	The next animal she was a Mamba snake. Mamba snake was shy :@@"I don't even know what a story is" she whispered in a hoarse voice and dispeared into the green grass.
P12	Since then, Mazanendaba learned that she must stop being a story teller of the village gossip and started spending more time with her family, teaching them more skills.....
