P1	One bright,sunny day,  in the wild,long forest there lived lots of beautiful, wild animals.They were enjoying living in the dark forest so much that they didn't let any humans come in.
P2	One day it was cold and foggy.The wild animals were still sleeping  but the white rabbit was awake.The wolf felt the sky falling!He went to tell his friends.
P3	The fluffy soft rabbit was as soft as the clouds.The rabbit told orange dry chicken first because he was his best friend.They went to warn their other friends.
P4	The second animal they told was brown,fluffy dog because he was the closest animal to him.The chicken shouted to the dog and he shouted " THE SKY IS FALLING!!The dog was so surprised.They started to shout "HELP!!!
P5	They then ran so fast that nobody could say hello to them because they were in a hurry to tell tall,fast horse.THE SKY IS FALLING!!! They shouted.The horse was in shock. They started to run around and scream.
P6	They were screaming so loud that a grey, short donkey came along.Why are you screaming?Asked the donkey.The animals replied and said"THE SKY IS FALLING!!!
P7	The donkey can't hear that well so he didn't hear what they said.The donkey said parden and all of the animals shouted in his ear and shouted THE SKY IS FALLING!!!
P8	Then the donkey heard what they said and he began to panic.he began to scream, shout and run.They all started to shout"THE SKY IS FALLING!!! They went to tell colourful, smooth cow.
P9	They told cow but cow wasn't shocked at all but the other animals were.The cow explained why he wasn't shocked.He said The sky isn't falling. It's not possible it was just a acorn.Then they stopped panicking and laughed. The End
