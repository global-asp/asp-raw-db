page_text:

P1	There are many ways to travel. Which shall I choose?
P2	Should I use a plane?
P3	Planes fly very high. I am afraid of flying!
P4	Perhaps I should use a helicopter?
P5	But helicopters and planes are the same!
P6	Should I perhaps use a train?
P7	But the train station is very far.
P8	Or,  perhaps,  I should use a bus?
P9	Our village has only one bus!
P10	Perhaps I shall use a lorry to travel.
P11	But lorries are used for carrying heavy luggage.
P12	Should I use a bicycle to travel?
P13	But will my father give me his bicycle?
P14	Perhaps I will try to use a boat?
P15	But I do not trust boats very much!
P16	Aah! I know what I shall use! I shall use a tractor to travel.
