desc:	Four fishermen go out to sea in their boat

page_text:

P1	Johnny is late to meet his friends to go fishing. @@When he arrives at the beach, he realises that he's forgotten to bring his lifejacket. @@"Don't worry," says Ben, the boat owner. "Here's a spare one I always keep on board."
P2	Because he's been fishing for years, Johnny knows the right way to put on a lifejacket. @@He fastens the two straps across his chest and the two straps between his legs. @@"Right!" he says, "it's on firmly and I'm ready to go!"
P3	On the ocean, they find a good spot to fish and put down the anchor. @@Out of nowhere, a huge wave suddenly rises above them. @@"Look! The wave's going to hit us!" shouts one of the fishermen.
P4	The boat is turned upside down and the men are flung into the water. @@"Eeeeeehhh!" they yell as they are plunged into the icy water. @@Not all of them can swim but, luckily, they are all wearing lifejackets.
P5	The men cling to the side of the upturned boat. @@Ben always carries a cellphone in a plastic pouch tied to his lifejacket. He calls the free emergency number 112. @@"Help! We're in trouble out at sea," he says to the operator.
P6	The Emergency Call Centre operator asks questions and listens carefully to Ben. @@She will be able to tell Sea Rescue exactly where the fishermen are.
P7	The men cling to the boat in the cold water, waiting. @@Johnny whistles a tune to keep up their spirits. Time seems to pass slowly.@@But after only 20 minutes, they hear the sound of a Sea Rescue boat arriving.
P8	They're here!" whoops Ben, when he sees the yellow and red Sea Rescue boat.@@"Yay!" the men chorus, happy to be alive.
P9	Soon the fishermen are wrapped in warm blankets and the Sea Rescue boat is taking them back to the beach. @@"Thank goodness we were all wearing lifejackets!" says Ben.
