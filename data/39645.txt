page_text:

P1	One day a farmer was taking his produce to the market. He felt thirsty. He met a woman fetching water by a spring.
P2	He asked the woman to give him water. She gave him water and invited him to go to her home. They went together and she gave him food. He ate the food, thanked her and went.
P3	On his way he found a bag full of money and a piece of paper with a phone number. He thought that he should do a good thing to people like the woman did for him. Therefore, he called the owner and gave the bag of money.
