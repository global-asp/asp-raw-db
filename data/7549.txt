page_text:

P1	There was a man called Lodipo. He lived with his two wives,  Akai and Akitela.
P2	Lodipo's first wife,  Akai,  was the only one who helped his blind mother.
P3	One day,  Lodipo's younger wife,  Akitela,  said,  "Let us move away to a safer place."  The place where they lived was constantly attacked by cattle raiders. Akitela felt unsafe.
P4	Lodipo told Akitela that his blind mother did not want to move. Akitela insisted that they should move,  and leave Lodipos' mother behind. "If we don't move away from here,  I will return to my parents," Akitela cried to Lodipo.
P5	Lodipo loved Akitela very much so  he gave in to her demands. They prepared to leave. The first wife,  Akai,  watched all this happening with confusion.
P6	Lodipo's blind mother sat on a goat skin under a tree. She was unaware of what was going on. "How can we leave her on her own?" Akai wondered to herself.
P7	Lodipo and his wives loaded all their belongings on their two camels. They left quietly without even saying goodbye to the old woman. Akai was crying because she was sad to leave her mother-in-law all alone.
P8	Immediately after Lodipo and his wives had left,  raiders attacked the place.
P9	The raiders asked the old woman to tell them where her son went. "We are going after him to kill him," they told her.  She pleaded,  "Don't kill the first wife and her children."  She also asked them to get back her ram,  which Lodipo took with him.
P10	The warriors followed Lodipo. Just as he was settling down in the new place,  they caught up with him. They killed him and his young wife.
P11	The first wife,  Akai,  went back with the ram. They lived together happily.
