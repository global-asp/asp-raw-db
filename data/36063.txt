page_text:

P1	Khalid Gambo lived with his parents in a village called Jagali. He had a very good friend called David Ibrahim. They lived in the same village, and went to the same school. @@Khalid's parents were Abba and Umma. Umma always advised her son, "Don't swim in any river or sea because it is dangerous."
P2	During the school vacation, Khalid Gambo travelled to Jauro Gotel (Yamaltu Deba). He went to spend the holiday with his uncle, Kabiru Hamza who was a very good fisherman. Kabiru Hamza had many canoes at Jauro Gotel.
P3	When Khalid Gambo returned from Jauro Gotel, he visited his friend David Ibrahim. He told David about his experiences and enjoyment, especially swimming in the sea! @@Khalid was interested and wished he had travelled with David to the sea.
P4	One afternoon, the two friends decided to swim in the village stream. They went out when nobody was watching.@@As soon as they got to the stream, Khalid Gambo jumped into the water with a splash. He called David Ibrahim to join him but he did not. He remembered his mother's advice.
P5	But Khalid finally convinced his friend to swim. They really enjoyed themselves in the water. @@It was getting late and the sun was setting. David told Khalid to get ready to go home. He got out of the water, dried himself and put on his clothes. Khalid was still in the water.
P6	At last Khalid decided to get out of the water. But he felt something pull his leg, and then a terrible pain. "What is the matter?" he cried. @@He turned, looked down into the water, and screamed. He saw a crocodile, the god of the stream! He started shouting for help.
P7	David Ibrahim heard his friend shouting. He went to help Khalid. @@David pulled his friend onto dry land and then rushed to the village to get help.@@The villagers heard David shouting and ran towards the stream. They found Khalid Gambo lying unconscious, with blood on the ground. They carried the boy to the clinic.
P8	The next day, Khalid woke up in a hospital bed with his parents and David Ibrahim standing beside him. He had a sharp pain in his left leg. @@They told him that his left leg was cut. Khalid started crying and begged his mother to forgive him. She replied quietly, "As the saying goes, 'Had I known is always last.' If only you had listened."
