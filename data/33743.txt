page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a royal couple who ruled over their people with love. @@Queen Sara and king Ade had everything they wanted. Except a child. @@Queen Sara yearned to be a mother, but the royal couple remained childless.
P2	One day, the queen mother suggested that a change of scenery might be good for her daughter-in-law. @@King Ade agreed and begged his wife to go for a vacation in Odufe, her father's hometown.
P3	So, queen Sara travelled to Odufe, to stay with her parents. @@They were delighted to see her, and tried to make her forget about her sorrow.
P4	Queen Sara was walking in the forest one morning when she came across a girl. @@The queen was impressed by the child's good manners. "What is your name and why are you in the forest alone?" she asked. @@"My name is Asa," said the girl.
P5	"And my parents are dead," she added. @@The queen asked, "Who looks after you?" Asa replied, "My aunt, but she doesn't care about me."@@There and then, queen Sara decided that she wanted to adopt Asa. The little angel needed love!
P6	Asa's aunt was relieved to get rid of her. She was barely thirty and didn't like to be tied down. @@She was pleased that the girl found someone to love her. @@Asa was a good child but her aunt just wasn't ready for the stress of motherhood!
P7	Queen Sarah took Asa back to the royal palace, where king Ade welcomed them with joy and love.@@There were great celebrations at the palace.
P8	And happiest of all were princess Asa and queen Sara!
