P2	Leapard : it's a simple game we all know it last time I won !! No need for explanations is that clear!.@@"Leapard being too bossy to the other animals since he won last time "
P3	Leopard : this time around we gonna start with this fat annoying guy!
P4	"Leapard disrespecting  the elephant "
P5	Elephant : I'll show you flames! @"In a aggressive way Elephant repied to the leapard"
P6	"Each animal was given a chance to play and it didn't work out for some"
P7	"It was even harder for other animals they could not even stay on the ground "
P8	"Until the   springbok said I will make it"
P9	"Leopard was so cruel to such an extent he didnt want the game to proceed because he knew that springbok is also fast he might loose the key"
