P5	Mmabotse taught her granny how to answer the phone. @@She said, "Granny, when you hear the phone ringing, press this green button and put the phone next to your ear to hear. Then start talking."
P6	Mmabotse  continued, "When you have finished the call, press this red button." @@She practised with granny many times.
P7	Mmabotse came back from school and called her granny on the cell phone. @@Her granny answered the phone and came back home. Now it was easy to find granny.
