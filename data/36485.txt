P1	She was the best she had the best life too. All of the sudden something changed. We moved in to a tiny camper. She hated it and soon it got worse. We got new puppies. They made a mess and chewed up chords. They loved to fight.
P2	That was not good that they fought. That made the kitten stay in her bed. She never came. There was a problem. She did not come out to eat. She stayed in there and never ate. So we out food in her bed and everything was going great for her.
