page_text:

P1	Everything around me and all that I see and hear, taste and touch and smell will make me who I am. I see blue skies and green grass and roads and trees.I hear birds singing in love and sadness and sometimes a blind rage.
P2	I taste the yummy freshly baked bread and touch the fur of my cat and feel his warmth.It is normal to feel frustrated and angry in one moment and sad and heartbroken in the next. We are all complex shapes and not flat.
P3	We are not meant to walk this earth with the old fashioned thinking of there can only be one good side and one bad side. There is good in bad and bad in good and there are alternative views. They are meant to be learnt and understood
P4	We all have our different energy and radiation. We are the designers and fashioners of our energy. We can choose to mirror an energy signature or oppose it. We may seek validation from the people around us at the cost of our own.
P5	We may feel victimised and blamed with none to turn to. We may ache with the pain of isolation from this difficulty. We may feel angry that no one can sympathize with us, and sad with no shoulder to cry into.
P6	And we may be lost and unsure. And this is completely fine. It is natural. It is human. It is what we feel and we must feel it, we do not stop ourselves from feeling. It is part of our nature and our lives.
P7	When we feel these feelings, we must let it out. We do not bottle it up. We can speak to a family member or a close friend. We can pour our hearts out onto a page. We are human. But we can change. And any day is a good day to start.
P8	If you have said things that weren't the true you then say your new words out loud. If you acted like someone else and not yourself act like yourself and do it with love.
P9	Spread your love and kindness and freed self to everyone you know and let them know the real you. And if someone objects to the true you then you have identified those who do not have your best interests at heart. And leave them behind.
