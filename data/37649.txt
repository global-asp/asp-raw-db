P1	There was once an old woman living by herself inside a bottle. She complained all the time. One Day a fairy passed by her home and saw her looking very sad. The fairy stopped and asked her, "what is the problem? Why are you so sad?
P2	I am tired of living in a bottle, "replied the old lady. The fairy said to her, stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times.
