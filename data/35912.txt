page_text:

P1	Sarah was picking flowers on a Wednesday afternoon. Suddenly, the sky looked funny.
P2	Then it started  raining.
P3	Sarah tried running, but she slipped on a puddle.
P4	She woke up 3 days later. She was in her bed, with a bandage on her head. Next to her bed was Sarah's mom, dad, little sister, and cousin. "What happened?" Asked Sarah. "You almost didn't make it through your coma." Said Sarah's mom.
P5	"Your very lucky to be alive" said Sarah's dad. Sarah holded her good luck charm.
