page_text:

P1	Follow the girl with the red umbrella.
P2	She will show you the forest.
P3	Look up.  What do you see?
P4	Look down. What do you see?
P5	The trees are so tall! They stretch up to see the sun.
P6	There are so many trees! Can you still see the girl with the red umbrella?
P7	There she is, waiting for you.
P8	She shows you a big tree with a wide trunk.
P9	Then she reads about rain forests.
P10	"The earth is becoming warmer and more dry all the time. There is more desert than ever before. There is less rain. When it does rain, there are often floods. This is because there is too much of a gas called carbon di-oxide in the air."
P11	"Rain forests can help us with this problem. The leafy trees and plants in forests take in carbon di-oxide. Their roots draw water up from the soil. With energy from the sun, the water and carbon di-oxide combine to make food."
P12	"Forests are also the lungs of the earth. When plants and trees make food from carbon di-oxide and water, they release oxygen, the most important part of the air we breathe. Without forests, there will not be enough oxygen in the air."
P13	The girl with the red umbrella closes the book. You follow her out of the Botanical Gardens in Mbombela.
