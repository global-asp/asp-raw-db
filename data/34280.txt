P2	I want it this morningüé∂@While listening to birds singing@I looked at the trees@Beautifully coloring the earth.@The heat of the sun@Warms and illuminates the Earth@I smiled and danced@Be grateful for this lifeüé∂@Thank you for this life for
P3	settling on it is very pleasant for me. ‚Äù Said the bee. Bees say arrogantly. Then they together surround the beautiful flower garden while dancing cheerfully.
P4	Caterpillar then as usual through his days on a twig of tree that turned thick. Start learning to walk faster. Keep trying until he is tired. Then trace the tree to look for fresh fruit.
