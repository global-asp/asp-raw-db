desc:	A story that makes us aware of the unhappy lives of cart horses in Debre Birhan (Ethiopia)

page_text:

P1	Chalew is a horse that pulls a cart.@@He carries heavy loads along the gravel roads of Debre Birhan. @@He works from morning to evening.
P2	Chalew does not get enough time to rest.@@He does not get enough food to eat.@@The driver of the cart beats him to go faster.
P3	One day, all the cart drivers gathered for a funeral.@@The cart horses were left to graze in a nearby field.@@They began to talk about their terrible conditions.
P4	"My harness doesn't fit me. It is too tight and cuts my skin," said one horse. @@"Me too, me too," another agreed.
P5	An old horse spoke, "I'm almost lame because of the nails they hammer into my hooves." @@More horses nodded in agreement.
P6	"We work very hard, but most of our owners treat us badly. Many do not know how to look after us," said Chalew. @@All of the horses agreed.
P7	"We need better conditions. Let's go on strike!" declared Chalew. The horses cheered! @@They decided to stay in the field until the cart drivers agreed to change.
P8	The cart drivers did not know what to do.@@"I can get another horse," boasted one driver.@@But most of the drivers needed their horses to earn a living.
P9	The drivers held a meeting to discuss the strike. They argued for a long time. @@"Maybe the horses are right," said one man. "Why should they get better conditions?" asked another.
P10	The horses' strike spread from the town of Debre Birhan across Ethiopia.@@Nearly three million horses refused to work.@@"We have had enough! Treat us fairly!" they said.
P11	So, the cart drivers were forced to change.@@They agreed to better conditions and fair treatment for all horses.@@They learned how to look after the horses, and keep them healthy.
P12	Slowly, the horses' lives improved. @@They got enough food and rest. Their harnesses fitted. They got better shoes for their hooves.@@Old Chalew became a hero to all horses!
