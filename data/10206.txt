page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there lived a king called Opale with his beautiful queen. They had only one beautiful daughter.
P2	One day,  a king looked at his princess and said to his wife,  "I think our daughter is grown up now,  we must find her a handsome man from the village."
P3	"Who will marry my beautiful princess?"  a king asked himself. He thought of a test for all men who will come expecting to marry his daughter. "I am going to cook a pot full of water and any man who will drink this hot water will marry my lovely daughter." said the king.
P4	The following day the king put up an announcement inviting all unmarried men in the village. Announcement! Announcement! To all young and unmarried men in the village, a king wants to find a handsome man for his beautiful daughter. Come,  Come,  Come all.
P5	On hearing the announcement, all young men were very excited and every body got set for the day.
P6	One of the young men told his father, I have had that the king has invited all young men to his palace, he wants to choose a husband for his daughter. Father, "I must go and stand before the king, am very sure I will come back with the princess."
P7	As usual, it was a proposed day, a queue of young and smartly dressed men was seen moving towards the palace. Every body was very happy.
P8	"You are all most welcome"said the king. Then the king began to address the crowd of young men, If any one drinks a pot of hot water all at once, he will be able to my lovely princess with him.
P9	They were very many in that the interview could not be complete within a day. Most men tried their level best but they could not go with the princess.
P10	On the following day, there came Mr Hare who had heard the announcement late. He was welcomed and given a seat.
P11	The king told him, to take my daughter, one has got to drink a pot of hot water all at once. That is nothing to me, my lord, said Mr Hare.
P12	Mr Hare was a very wise and tricky man, he started a very interesting story that took up the king's attention while the water was cooling.
P13	The chiefs and the king were very happy saying,  "This is the man we wanted." In a few minutes, the hot water had cooled and Mr Hare drank it all at once.
P14	The king and his chiefs were very surprised to see Mr Hare drinking the hot water.
P15	Finally Mr Hare took the beautiful princess with him and he was very happy but the king remained very sad because his daughter had gone with an animal.
