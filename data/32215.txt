page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a boy named Wayan. Wayan lived in Indonesia, in a small village by the sea. The village lay at the foot of a big volcano. All the beaches had black sand because of the volcano.@@The villagers grew rice, mangoes, bananas, coconuts, papayas, snake fruit and dragon fruit. No one ever went hungry.@@The sea was very important to the villagers. It was a special place where the ancestors lived. The villagers believed that when you died you returned to the sea.
P2	Wayan's father and grandfather were both  fishermen. In fact, most men in the village were fishermen. It had been like this since time began. You had to be very strong to be a fisherman. When Wayan grows up, he will be a fisherman too.@@Every morning, at sunrise, the men took the jukung boat out to go fishing. Every evening, at sunset, they came back with their boats full of fish. There were big ones, small ones, grey ones and colourful ones.
P3	One day, Wayan's grandfather got sick and died. Everyone was very sad. They held a big ceremony to say goodbye, and then put his ashes in the sea, home of the ancestors.
P4	Time passed and Wayan grew up. He was a fisherman now and his father was getting older. One day, Wayan would be the head of the family, but he still had a lot to learn before then.@@Things were changing. There were fewer fish these days so the fishermen had to stay out on the sea for longer. @@Some days, the jukung boats came back empty, even after they had been out at sea from sunrise to sunset.
P5	Where had all the fish gone? When they did catch fish, they were all small and they didn't taste good. @@The beaches had also changed. They used to be clean and beautiful, but now there was plastic everywhere you looked: plastic cups, water bottles, straws and bags – even flip flops!
P6	There was so much trash that it was hard to see the black sand underneath! Villagers used things only once before throwing them away. They didn't think twice about throwing trash on the ground. It was "normal" to see plastic everywhere. Even the rice fields were covered in plastic.@@Sometimes the villagers burnt the plastic,and sometimes they just threw trash into the dry riverbeds.@@When the tide came in or it rained, it took@all the trash away so the problem went@away too. Or so people thought...
P7	People in the village started getting sick but no one knew why. "Why was there no more fish? Why was everyone sick? How can we stop all these bad things from happening?"  the villagers wondered.
P8	One day, while Wayan was fishing, he fell overboard. He almost drowned, but a turtle saved him. The turtle's name was Bintang*. He said: "Climb onto my back. I'll take care of you."@@"Thank you turtle," Wayan said. "How can I ever repay you for saving my life?"@@"Well, maybe you can help me. My grandfather is 200 years old. He is the wisest turtle I know. He is very sick and no one knows what to do. Maybe you can help him?" asked Bintang.@@(*Bintang means 'star'.)
P9	Bintang took Wayan to Turtle Town. Wayan thought that he would see lots of cute baby turtles, but no... he mostly saw plastic lying around everywhere.@@Bintang introduced Wayan to his grandfather. He was very, very sick an found it difficult to speak or breathe.@@Wayan saw something strange sticking out of Bintang's grandfather's nose.@@He said: "Wait! I will try to pull this thing out, but it might hurt, okay?"
P10	He pulled and pulled and pulled. Bintang's grandfather cried out in pain. Finally, the thing came out. What was it?! It looked like bone! But it wasn't bone.@@It was a plastic straw! A plastic straw?! In a turtle's nose?! How did it get there?@@"Oh, thank you Wayan! You saved my life. I can breathe again," he said. "I am Galih, King of the Turtles."@@Wayan bowed to the King.
P11	"I need to show you all the sick turtles in my kingdom. Please follow me," said King Galih.@@They went to Turtle Hospital where many sick turtles, big and small, lay crying in pain. "What's wrong with them?" asked Wayan.@@"We don't know," the King said. "They got sick after eating jellyfish, but we've been eating jellyfish since time began. No one has ever been sick before."@@King Galih showed Wayan one of the jellyfish that they'd taken out of a sick turtle.
P12	"That's not a jellyfish. That's a plastic bag!" said Wayan. "Why do you eat plastic, King Galih? It's not food!"@@King Galih explained: "You see Wayan turtles can't see well. To us, a plastic bag looks just like a jellyfish."@@Then, the King asked a favour: "Could you help us? Could you tell people not to use plastic bags and straws anymore? Could you tell them what you've seen here? Please. We need your help. Without it, we will die."
P13	Wayan bowed to the King and promised that he would do his best to help the turtles. He held onto Bintang's back and returned to his village.@@On their journey, they saw lots of plastic bags in the water and YES! They DID look like jellyfish.@@Wayan suddenly understood that the villagers had become blind to the plastic around them.@@He realised that things needed to change. He called a meeting and told the villagers about his adventure and all the things he had seen.
P14	That night, the head of the village made some new rules:@@• Plastic straws, bags, bottles and cups are banned.@• Don't burn plastic.@• Don't bury plastic in the ground.@• Clean the beaches, rice fields and village.@• Make useful things from the collected plastic trash.@• Collect plastic from the sea instead of fish.@• Don't catch or eat fish until the sea is clean.
P15	It was hard work, and for a while, people didn't eat fish: only fruit, vegetables and rice. Finally, after three years of cleaning, there was no more plastic polluting the rice fields or sea.@@People had turned plastic into useful things like tables and chairs. They no longer used single-use plastic straws or water bottles.@@Instead of plastic straws, they used bamboo straws. Instead of plastic bags, they used bags made from fabric that could be used again and again. Instead of plastic water bottles and cups, they used reusable ones, like glass.@@They learnt that the ways of their ancestors were better than the modern, wasteful ways.
P16	The villagers understood that they were part of nature. If the animals and earth were healthy, the villagers would be healthy too. If the animals and earth were sick, they would also be sick.@@After three years, there were thousands of fish again: big ones and small ones, grey ones and colourful ones.@@The villagers stopped being sick. The fish and turtles were healthy too. The people were happy. The earth was happy. The ancestors were happy. And so was the ocean.@@The End
