page_text:

P1	In North West we have a village called Bethel which is outside of Mahikeng.
P2	In that village lived a little girl named Larona. She was very obedient and curious. She always asked questions about things she did not understand.
P3	One day she went to town with her mother using a taxi, she saw a light skinned girl with yellow hair. She asked her mother: " Is she white mommy and does she speak Setswana?" Her mother explained, " she has a condition called Albinism".
P4	When they arrived in town they met a woman who uses crutches to walk. She asked again, " mommy why is she using sticks to walk?" Her mother replied. "They are called crutches, they balance her when she walks so she does not fall".
P5	While walking she saw two people signing. She got curious again and asked, "mommy what are they doing with their hands?" Her mother explained, " they can't speak like us, so they use their hands to communicate. It is called a sign language"
P6	Along the way she saw q man sitting in a moving chair and told her mother, " I wish I had a chair like his". Her mother explained, " It's called a wheelchair. People who use it can not stand or walk like us".
P7	While they were queuing in a grocery store, she saw a dark skinned boy and curiously asked again. "Mommy why is that boy so dark, does he play in the sun too much". Her mother said, "there are those who are darker and lighter than us".
P8	From that day Larona got to know that everyone is uniquely made in their own way. As unique as we are we require equal treatment and love.
