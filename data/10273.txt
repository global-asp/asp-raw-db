page_text:

P1	In Nakwiga Forest,  there lived Monkey who was always lonely but friendly. She had miscarriages most times.
P2	The pain of having miscarriages made Monkey jump up and down all the time. She would jump from one tree to another saying "Kau! Kau! Kau!"
P3	Monkey was always lonely. She felt bad when she saw other monkeys carrying their babies on their backs.
P4	The lonely Monkey would sway this way and that way. She would sway on this branch and on that branch! She would sway on this tree and the other tree! Days passed and Monkey cried more and more.
P5	Then she conceived again and gave birth. She decided to take the baby to the path so that people passing by going to the river would see the baby and wish it well.
P6	Monkey climbed down from the branch and put the baby on the path and climbed up and sat in between the branches to watch whoever passed by. At that time,  a hunter and his dog were returning home. He saw the baby monkey lying on the side of the path.
P7	The hunter carried the baby monkey to his home. When the hunter reached home,  his three boys were excited to meet a new friend. They started playing with the baby monkey. They jumped up and down and fed it.
P8	The three boys sang: "Baby monkey you will not fall down we love you baby monkey x2 The monkey was thrown up and the boys couldn't allow it to fall down at all."
P9	As the three boys played with the baby monkey,  mother Monkey was watching them. She was scared that her baby would fall down and break as the boys were throwing it up.
P10	The kind woman came and saw young boys playing with the baby monkey. She said politely to them,  "Be careful! Bring it here. You will break it!"
P11	She took the baby monkey in her arms,  and blessed it in the way they bless animals in her religion.
P12	When the woman put the baby monkey down,  mother Monkey came running with a lot of joy. She held her baby to her chest and she disappeared up the tree.
