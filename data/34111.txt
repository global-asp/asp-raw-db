page_text:

P1	Wayan lived in a small village by the sea.@@The people there believed that when you died, you returned to the sea. @@The sea is a special place where the ancestors live.
P2	Wayan's father and grandfather were fishermen. Most men in the village were fishermen, and it was always that way. @@Every morning at sunrise, the men went fishing in  jukung boats. Every evening at sunset, they came back with their boats full of fish.
P3	Wayan learned to fish just as everything was changing for the fishermen. @@There were fewer fish, and they were always small. @@Sometimes, the boats came back empty, even though they had been at sea all day.
P4	The beaches also changed. They were always polluted, with plastic trash thrown on the sand. @@When the tide went out, it washed plastic into the sea. @@Gradually, people in the village began to get sick. They could not get well.
P5	One day, while Wayan was fishing, a storm blew over. He was swept into the waves. @@A turtle saved him. "I am Bintang. I will help you, climb onto my back," said the turtle.@@"Maybe you can help me. My grandfather is very sick and no one knows what to do."
P6	Bintang took Wayan to his grandfather. The old turtle was very ill and finding it difficult to breathe.@@Wayan saw something strange sticking out of  grandfather's nose. He said, "I will try to pull out this thing, but it will hurt!" @@Wayan pulled and pulled. Grandfather cried and cried.
P7	Finally, the thing came out. It was a plastic straw! The straw had stuck down grandfather's throat. @@Grandfather began to breathe more easily. Bintang said to Wayan, "I will take you to the others."@@They went to Turtle Hospital. "What happened to these turtles?" asked Wayan.
P8	"They ate plastic bags, thinking it was food. We turtles cannot see very well. To us, a plastic bag looks like a jelly fish," explained Bintang.@@He asked,"We need your help. Please tell people not to throw plastic on the earth or into the water."
P9	Wayan promised that he would do his best to help. Bintang carried him back to the shore, and then swam away. @@Wayan realised that the villagers needed to clean up the sea and beaches. @@He ran to the elders to tell them about the turtles.
P10	The head of the village called a meeting and everyone gathered to hear Wayan's story.@@The villagers discussed the problem for a long time. Finally, they agreed on important actions to save their ocean and its animals and plants.
P11	People agreed to a ban on plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags. @@They agreed to throw their trash into trash bins only, and to stop burning and burying plastic. @@They decided to stop fishing until the sea was clean.
P12	Eventually, the sea and beaches returned to the way they were before Wayan was born.@@The water was clean and full of life. People were no longer sick from eating sick fish.@@Wayan learned that when the sea is polluted, we all suffer. When the sea is healthy, we can all be happy.
