page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, they were three friends, Chase, the rabbit, Cheezi, the fox, and Janja, the hyena.
P2	One day, they went to the park to play. On the way, suddenly Janja’s foot stepped on a twig. He fell into a hole. It was very deep.
P3	‘This is too deep. I fell. Can anyone help me please?’ shouted Janja.
P4	Chase and Cheezi were worried about their friend. @It was getting dark, Chase and Cheezi thought that he would get scared, feel cold and get sick.
P5	Janja said ‘It’s getting dark. I don’t know what to do.’
P6	They called the rescue team, [Goigoi, Reirei, Kiara, Popatison.]
P7	Goigoi, the scout received the call from Cheezi and Chase. @‘What's wrong?’ asked Goigoi.@ ‘Well, Janja stepped on a twig and fell into a hole that is very deep, deep ’,Chase and Cheezi said.
P8	Ok, we’ll be right there’’, said Goigoi. @[Emergency music] te-daa, te-daa, te-daa
P9	‘What's wrong?’ Kiara, the lioness asked Goigoi.  @ ‘Janja stepped on a twig and fell into a hole that is very deep, deep, deep. Let's go and save him’, Goigoi said.
P10	‘OK, let's go and save him’, said Popatison, the lion.@They went out to save him.@‘Don’t worry, we are coming,’ said Goigoi.
P11	Here's the plan. I will go down by a rope and save him. While coming up, Reirei will use your light power to show us the way. But it will be too deep, deep, deep.
P12	So Popatison will use his sonic roar to pull us. And Kiara will keep Cheezi and Chase safe.’@OK….. , said everyone.
P13	Goigoi went down in the deep, deep, deep hole and found Janja. He tried to come up but couldn’t. Then Popatison and Reirei used their powers together to save Janja. [hew…..]
P14	Good plan Goigoi,’ said Reirei.@‘Thanks,’ said Goigoi.@Goigoi asked Janja to be careful next time.
P15	You must never step on a twig. It is dangerous. Promise me you will never do it again,’ said Popatison.@They all promised.
P16	Everyone played together.@---------------------THE END-------------------
