P1	Once upon a time the family went swimming. There names were Rosanna, Robert, and Penelope.
P2	And then we looked in the sky and saw a huge pretty butterfly.
P3	And then my mom and me went outside and we saw it raining. After it rained, we saw a rainbow.
P4	I started to get hungry. I ate some fruit.
P5	My friends came over to the house to come and play with me.
P6	And then we surprise them to come to my party for my birthday.
P7	And then I did my homework. @The end of storybook.
