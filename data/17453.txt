desc:	Hare is playing tricks again!

page_text:

P1	One day,  Hare was out looking for food. He met Elephant,  who had a pot of honey. Hare asked Elephant,  "Please be kind and carry me. I am weak."
P2	Elephant agreed to carry Hare. Hare got onto Elephant's back and held on tightly. He started eating Elephant's honey straight away!
P3	Honey began dripping on Elephant's back. When Elephant asked what it was,  Hare said that it was from his wound.
P4	They reached a river and found a large buffalo drinking water.
P5	Hare wanted to know who was stronger,  Buffalo or Elephant.
P6	They began arguing. Elephant said she was stronger and Buffalo said she was stronger.
P7	Hare said he had an idea how to find out who was stronger. He asked them to wait for him there.
P8	Hare came back with a long rope. He tied the one end around Elephant's waist and led her away from the river.
P9	Hare tied the other end of the rope around Buffalo's waist and left her near the river.
P10	Hare ran and hid himself in a tree. He shouted,  "Ready! One,  two,  three! Pull!"
P11	Buffalo and Elephant pulled. Elephant pulled Buffalo.
P12	Buffalo pulled Elephant. Neither could win.
P13	From where he was hiding,  Hare continued to eat Elephant's honey.
P14	After he had finished the honey,  he cut the rope closer to Buffalo.
P15	Elephant fell over hard and hit a tree.
P16	Hare went to Buffalo and praised her,  saying that she was stronger.
