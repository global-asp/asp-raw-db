P1	In Crystal Classic Academy, there was a young boy named Nyimutaban. He loved drawing but his parents discouraged him.
P2	He used all his notebooks to draw. His parents and teachers always punished him.
P3	His parents got him a lesson teacher, Mr Ngavo. He was a very kind man. He allowed him to practice his drawing after lessons.
P4	Mr Ngavo also got him drawing books, boards and colours. Overtime, he became perfect in drawing and also the best in all subjects.
P5	Nyimutaban received many prizes and gifts during the school's annual prize-giving days. Many students loved him and tried to be like him.
P6	When he grew up, he was among the best artists in Nigeria. He won a lot of awards and contracts.
P7	He thought of what to do for other children who loved arts but were forced to study science subjects.
P8	He established the Nyimutaban Arts Centre where young children were taught arts after school hours. He organized and sponsored art competitions which helped children develop their talent.
