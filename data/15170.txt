page_text:

P1	Long time ago there was a man who had two wives. The two wives gave birth to two daughters,  Adie and Adhoch. The step sisters loved each other very much.
P2	Adie was hard working,  neat,  kind and well behaved. Adhoch,  on the other hand,  was lazy,  unkind and untidy.
P3	Teachers loved Adie. She got many presents for her hard work. Adhoch did not receive any.  Adhoch's mother was jealous of Adie.
P4	Adie's mother became sick and died.  Adie's stepmother did not love her as her mother did.
P5	Adhoch's mother made Adie do all the work.  She did not have time to get ready for school.  Adhoch studied and played when Adie was busy working.
P6	Adie still did well in school. She passed her exams and received more presents.    This made Adhoch's mother very very angry.
P7	One day,  Adhoch's mother asked Adie to go with her to the lake to fetch water.    When they reached,  Adhoch's mother told her to go deeper into the lake to fetch clean water. Big waves rose and Adie drowned.
P8	The stepmother went back home. Adhoch asked where her sister was.  Her mother said,  "Adie is at the lake with her friends. She will come home later."
P9	When night fell,  Adhoch went to look for her sister at the lake. She called her name,  "Adie! Where are you?" Adhoch heard,  "I am in the lake. Mother drowned me."
P10	Adhoch walked into the lake calling her sister. "Adie! Where are you?"  She heard the same reply,  "I am in the lake. Mother drowned me."
P11	Adhoch got deep into the lake. She drowned in the same way as Adie.
P12	Adhoch's mother was sad. She lost Adhoch because she was jealous of Adie. She had to do all the work herself.
