P1	I almost died one time in a granary. My elder brother and I were left home all alone when everybody went to dig. It was 1: 00 pm and we felt hungry. No one had come back from the field work. Amidst tears I told my brother,  "Look,  Father has some ripe bananas in the granary and they smell so sweet. Come and smell." My brother came and exclaimed,  "Ooooh,  it smells so nice."
P2	"Can't we open the granary and eat some?" I asked. "No! Father will beat us," answered my brother. "No! I know what I will tell him. You know he loves me,  he will even be angry with mother for leaving us hungry," I answered. "Ok,  let's try to open the granary," said my brother. We struggled and succeeded in opening the door. "Ohhh!" I exclaimed on seeing the mouthwatering tasty fruits. I picked one and gulped it down before lifting my brother into the granary.
P3	Excited,  we both jumped up and down shouting,  "We weewee,  bananas are ripe,  shall we finish?" Satisfied and jubilant Â we screamed,  "Nyam,  nyam,  nyam." Little did I know that the pole would slip and the granary would close and imprison us inside. "Riii- boom",  it closed us in. We almost cried our eyes out,  yet no one came to rescue us. We fell asleep and woke up to eat again,  but it was too hot inside our prison. We sweated and almost suffocated. I could place my nose where there was air coming through but it was not enough. We felt very weak.
P4	My parents arrived at 4: 00 pm when we were helpless. They looked for us in vain. I wanted to cough,  but my brother held my mouth tightly because of fear. "Rua-rua-rua",  I breathed but I couldn't suppress the cough. Alas,  I coughed and my father heard my voice and said,  "Listen! They are in the granary." He opened the granary while my brother urinated out of fear. "You deserve it! I will punish you if I get my banana eaters."
P5	He first picked me up and as he put me down on the ground my brother was prepared to jump out of the granary. Swiftly he ran away. When my father was looking for which direction he took,  I also fled. They couldn't catch either one of us.
P6	The lesson that I learned was,  we should respect our parents and parents should take care of their kids.
