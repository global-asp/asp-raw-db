P1	Romo wakes up every morning at 6am so as to go to school.  He puts in his clothes while thinking about his favorite hobby. Soccer.
P2	While his father prepares his breakfast, Romo prepares his suitcase.  He is so happy because today he is going to play soccer with his best friend, Sofo who is very good at shooting the ball.
P3	Sofo actually is a girl.  He likes her a lot. She is beautiful and has a sunshine smile. She plays soccer but she is not running very fast.  But she is really good at scoring.
P4	When Romo arrives at school, his teacher gives everybody a sport outfit. Romo is very excited. He and his team are ready. Sofo is playing too.
P5	The teacher gives the guidelines for the game.  All students are listening very carefully.  "The best team will be the one that will play as one", says the teacher.  All are excited no matter who will win.
P6	The game starts.  Romo is running so fast and passes the ball at Sofo who scores 5 goals. Everybody is thrilled.
P7	"Romo, that was a wonderful game! Your team  scored 5 goals!  You passed the ball to Sofo and Sofo scored.  This is a team's work! This is called collaboration ! I am so proud of you all" said the teacher.
P8	"We are Romo's team!", shouted all. Everyone was happy because together they made it !
