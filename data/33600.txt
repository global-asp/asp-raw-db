page_text:

P1	My imagination is like a key that opens every door!
P2	In my imagination, my umbrella has two handles so I can hold it with my sister.
P3	In my imagination, there are superhero bees.
P4	Super bees, who fly around in water just as easily...
P5	...as they can fly in the air!
P6	In my imagination, flowers grow in boots and sing.
P7	In my imagination, every child has ice cream for supper...
P8	...and then falls asleep as flowers sing to a purple moon.
