page_text:

P1	Once upon time,  a lion wanted to come out of the bush and have a human as a friend.
P2	And so the lion and the man became friends.
P3	They ate together and shared meat. The lion realised that the man was a meat lover. It began to fear that the man would kill it.
P4	The lion feared that perhaps the man might spear it with his spears. The man feared that the lion might eat him at night when he slept.
P5	One night the man dreamed that the lion was moving towards him slowly,  trying to eat him.
P6	The man took up his spear,  shouting,  "If you want to eat me,  then I will spear you." The lion woke up and ran out,  "I said this man will one day kill me."
P7	From that day,  the lion and the man were no longer friends. The lion will kill a human whenever it finds one. And humans will kill a lion if they can.
P8	That is why it is said: if someone wants friendship with you,  you should first know about that person's character. You should know if you can be together peacefully.
