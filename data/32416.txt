page_text:

P1	The sun rises in the morning, by the east side.@@I hear the cock crow at dawn.
P2	The sun moves over Terfa's compound before the morning meal.@@I smell the aroma of bier and akpupa following the sun to my window.
P3	The sun goes behind a tree at school during lunchtime. @@Then it arrives in a puddle in the middle of the playground.
P4	The sun stands above my head. My shadow stands beside me. @@I play the shadow game with my friends.
P5	My shadow grows bigger, then smaller. We run after it.@@My shadow grows longer, then shorter. We run after it.
P6	I stand, my friends stand. We see our shadows sway. @@We grow tired and return to class. After school, we go home.
P7	The sun yawns. @@I see the sun sink slowly in the west. I see my shadow on a wall. @@It is time to go to bed.
P8	The sun goes down behind the clouds.@@I lay down in my bed, and dream of the sun traveling afar.
