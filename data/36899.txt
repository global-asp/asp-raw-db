page_text:

P1	Layla was only six years old when she started helping her mother in the garden.
P2	Together they planted different vegetables and flowers. Their garden had carrots, green beans, potatoes, tomatoes, onions and beautiful flowers.
P3	Layla loved helping her mother in the garden and more so she loved playing with water.
P4	When Layla isn't helping her mom in the garden, she is playing with her friends.
P5	They sold vegetables in the neighbourhood and with the money they made they were able to but groceries.
P6	Her brother and sister go to school using the money that they make from selling vegetables.
P7	Layla asked her mother if they could open a market and her mother said that, that was a good idea.
P8	It's always been Layla's dream to own her very own market, or even become one of the biggest suppliers nationwide.
P9	Layla would love to buy her mother and siblings a big house so can all live comfortably.
P10	With a lot of hard work, planting and a whole lot more ploughing, Layla's dream became a reality. She supplied all the small markets with fruit and vegetables, Layla bought her mother and siblings a big house and they all lived happily ever after.
