P1	There once was a girl called Hope who lived with her grandma and little sister.Hope's grandma always told stories about a magical village hidden in the heart of Limpopo where there were talking animals and the people would dance and sing.
P2	Everyone was invited into this magical place until one day a great king came and yelled at the people "I own this magical place now." The people were frustrated and their skin turned red then one day two kids selling mangoes came and said-
P3	"We've got the solution to all your problems take the magical fruit seeds we give you and plant them in your garden." The people were anxious to hear their plant so they begged and begged "These fruit aren't normal they will grow  into...
P4	Giant warriors who will protect you from the king." Said the two kids the people all enjoyed the plan so the next day everyone planted the magical trees, they were amazed by how fast they grew.The king soon came and was angry at the village
P5	So the king complained to a snake and sent him to a village.The snake slithered into the village in the dark night, when he finally arrived he told the chief that the fruits were killing the people so the chief told the people to stop now.
P6	The villagers immediately cut down all of the trees and the chief started coming to the village with big horses."oh king the snake has tricked you into cutting down all the trees." The king then planned to regrow the trees they grew quickly
P7	They grew even quicker and bigger than before.So the evil king sent a lion to trick the chief.The lion told the chief about the people getting ill so he cut the trees again.The two kids got worried and talked to the king again so they ...
P8	The kids got mad and thought of a plan "what if we pretend to be the lion, the witch has a great spell." The witch turned them into a lion and they went to the evil King  and said " we should let them grow so we could steal for ourselves."
P9	So he sent 3 birds, a rhino, a lion a tortoise and a rabbit.They bit all the fruit and were very proud but when they went to the king he was furious." The fruit have gone again." He shouted and the animals started to wobble and fall."What!"
P10	The king screamed just then the two kids came with an apple " its a magic spell you won't come again." Said the girl and the king never came again so the village people celebrated and laughed and the king sat in the castle.THE END!
