desc:	Story about the power of wind.

page_text:

P1	The wind roars. It roars past our home.
P2	The wind is powerful. It tears my kite from my hand.
P3	I run after my kite. The wind blows me away from the kite!
P4	The wind becomes a tornado. It carries my kite higher and higher.
P5	The tornado swallows me up! I see nothing,  I touch nothing.
P6	Where is my kite now? Perhaps it is caught in a tree.
P7	Perhaps my kite is still flying in the sky.
P8	The wind finally dies down. I am still spinning.
P9	When I stop spinning I look around. Where did the wind go?
P10	I cannot see my kite anywhere. I cannot hear the wind anymore.
P11	Perhaps tomorrow I will find my kite. Now,  I must go home,  before the wind starts to roar again.
