desc:	When Halima came in and saw the pile of meat

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a hard working farmer called suddi.He lived with his wife Halima,in a small village far away in the hills.Suddi grew food crops for his family, and pumpkins which he sold to his neighbours.
P2	He was not rich, but he made enough money for his daily needs  One year, however, there was very little rain in the area.The crops failed and the pumpkins on Suddi's  farm were too small  to sell. Suddi wondered how he will feed his family.
P3	One day, he was walking around the farm thinking about this problem. when he suddenly noticed a pumpkin that was different from all the others.It was greener and much bigger.
P4	Suddi bent down to see it clearly. He saw that it had very unusual shape. It looked like the head of man. There was black marks for the eyes,a small lump where the nose should be. Under the nose, a crack which looks like a mouth.
P5	Suddi stared at the strange pumpkin for a few minutes. The  mouth seemed to smile at him and he found himself smiling back at it. ”Welcome fine pumpkin, he said. I am going to hide you so that no one steals us.”
P6	He gathered some grass and sticks to cover the pumpkin with them.Each morning, Suddi went to see how it was doing, each day it grew bigger and finner. A few weeks later, when the pumpkin seemed to be fully grown, Suddi picked  it up.
P7	He wrapped it in a blanket and hid it under the bed.That evening, Suddi was sitting alone in his room. He was eating dry cassava from a bowl for that time there was nothing else to eat.He told his wife about the pumpkin.
P8	he decided to look at it once again.He took it out and put it beside him.The pumpkin smiled at him in a friendly way.Suddi put out his  hand and patted it.
P9	I wish i had some meat to eat with this cassava, he said aloud. The next moment, a piece of meat fell into his bowl! Then another and another! soon the cassava was covered with meat and the bowl was full, but the meat still falling.
P10	Suddi began to feel afraid how could he tell the pumpkin that he had now enough? Without thinking, he once more put his hand and patted the pumpkin twice.As he did so, he said the first words that came into his mind.Enough!  That enough!
P11	At one the meat stopped falling, and there was silence in the room for a few minutes. Suddi just stared at the pumpkin, He was too surprised even to eat the meat. Then he called his wife. "Halima", come here.
