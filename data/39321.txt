page_text:

P1	Faraway, in a small town,there was a boy named Akanni.Being the only son of his parents, he was given all he wanted and he grew up to be disobedient, covetous and playful.@His parents grew worried about his attitude and warned him always.
P2	But he heeded deaf ears to what everyone was telling him.He wanted no one to correct him.For that, he had no friends except for one,Banjo whose father had died and the mother rarely stays at home.Akanni ignored everyone until One day....
P3	Akanni and his mother were walking back from a trader's home when he spotted some fresh mangoes on a tree.He turned back,deciding to get a taste.@"Akanni,don't tell me you want to pluck those mangoes,you had better not", His mother warned.
P4	With a firm face,Akanni ignored his mother's warnings and climbed the tree swiftly.@"I don't know why she is always not letting me be for once,how can I resist these juicy mangoes which no one is ready to get a taste,its my life", He thought
P5	Plucking a mango,he smiled as his mother watched,baffled.@"Akanni,remember what your father talked about stealing and about this path.Get down now and I will get a basket of mangoes for you,Lets go", His mother tried to convince him.
P6	Akanni whistled and jumped.Taking to his heels,he ran across another path so his mother would be unable to find him.@"Why can't I get a taste?", He thought as he ate it and it actually tastes better!Thank God he didnt listen to his mother.
P7	Suddenly,he felt an unusual stomach pains.The mango dropped off from his hands as he tried to call for help..@How stupid he was?No one would actually find him here as this was far into the bushes.@Akanni fell and groaned in serious pain.
P8	He thought of his parent and only friend.He thought of all the warnings his mother gave him.@He remembered how everyone tried to change him.He died with the mango by his side.@@Lesson learnt;Always listen to your parents.@Never be covetous.
