P1	When I get to the park, I firstly go to the slide! Whoo-Hoo! So much fun!
P2	Secondly, I go on the monkey bars! Whoo-Hoo! Look at me! I'm a monkey, ooh-ah-ah!
P3	Thirdly, I go on the swing! Whoo- Hoo! Look at me! I'm going as hight as the sky!
P4	Fourthly, I see a ball! I take it and I play soccer by myself!
P5	My ball hit a toy truck! It looks fun to gather up some sand with it! Let's play!
P6	I also see a rocket ship toy! Lets take off! Hehehe.
P7	It has been so much fun at the park today! I guess its time to head home! I'll definitely be here again tomorrow! Bye Guys! Haha ðŸ˜„!
