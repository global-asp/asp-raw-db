page_text:

P1	When Swara wakes up in the morning, the first thing she does is wake her sister up, Sayesha. Swara and Sayesha love to be with eachother. @@They wake up, brush their teeth and drink their milk.
P2	As early as 8am, you can already hear Swara say, it's hot, can I please turn the fan on.@@Daddy and Baa are not feeling hot, only Swara and mummy feel hot. @@Swara says, oh please let me turn the fan on
P3	Swara feels hot even as she's in her room. Can you please open the windows, you can hear her loud and clear.@@She turns the fan on and and gets in the most comfortable made from cotton, preferably without labels.
P4	In summers Swara and Sayesha love the pool.@@Enjoying their time in the pool with their toys and bubbles is the best time of the day.
P5	Afternoon is the wrost time of the day when the sun shows right above the head.@Swara feels sweaty and itchy. @@Swara says I want the AC. @@She has fun with Sayesha after lunch, in her favourite sleeveless frocks !
P6	Hard time of the day is tennis time.@@It's hot in summers when Swara goes to tennis.@@Swara likes tennis and her cycling shorts and colourful skirts. They keep her cool.@@The wrist band is a must to keep all the sweat off her face.
P7	Swara likes the AC, but Baa doesn't like the AC. @@School nights are the nights Swara and Sayesha sleep with baa, but without the AC?@@So there starts the hustle about who will sleep where.@@Swara doesn't want to sleep without Sayesha.
P8	Swara wants to sleep with mummy because mummy's room has the AC. Swara also wants Sayesha. So there's no room for daddy on the bed.@@Daddy always ends up going to Swara's room.
P9	This summer, Swara is going to love it.@@She's going to sleep in her own room with Sayesha in the AC.@@Sayesha needs the mosquito net and Swara needs the AC.@@Baa needs the window open and Dad wants to sleep on his bed.@@Everyone is sleepy
P10	This summer is awesome, as Swara grows up to be independent.@@She puts the baby to sleep and reads her a story.@@All while she sleeps in her room with the AC.
