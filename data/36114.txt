P1	For the children in every country of Africa
P2	One day, my big sister  Zila had this idea. @@"I am going to make masks for those people in the community who don't have masks!" she said. @@"That's a good idea! Let's tell Mama and Baba when they get home!" I said.
P3	When Mama and Baba arrived home, we told them about Zila's idea. @@"That's a good idea, my child!" Baba said, and Mama agreed. @@"I will ask our church members to give us cloth to make the masks. Let's ask Gogo to help with sewing."
P4	The next day, the church ladies dropped off colourful cloth and elastic at our house.@@Zila left some cloth and elastic in a bag outside Gogo's door, with a note asking Gogo to help.
P5	Zila started stitching masks and Wandi and I watched her. @@Zila is very good at stitching. She stitched many masks. @@Wandi and I counted the masks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, then, 100!
P6	Zila and Gogo made enough masks for everyone in the community! @@We helped them!@@Mama and Baba were so proud.
P7	The next day, Baba and Mama were not working. They decided to give out the masks to anyone who needed a mask. @@Zila carried Mama's hand sanitiser and sprayed people's hands. "Remember to wash your mask every day," said Mama.
P8	Now when Zila goes to get water, everyone is wearing masks. @@Everyone looks and feels safer.
P9	Later, Mama asked, "Children, what do we do after we touch anything?"@@"We wash our hands with soap and water!" Wandile said. "Or use sanitiser," I added.@@Mama smiled, "And what do we wear when we go out?" We all shouted, "Our masks!"
P10	1. Wash your hands with water.@2. Use soap to wash your hands.@3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.@4. Rinse your hands with water.@5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.@6. Now your hands are clean!
