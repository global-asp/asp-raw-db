P1	One day,  Nakehi and his wife went to visit Nipapariya and his wife.
P2	When the couple arrived,  Nipapariya and his wife graciously welcomed them.
P3	They killed a chicken and cooked it.
P4	And they all ate together.
P5	The next week,  Nipapariya and his wife went to visit Nakehi and his wife.
P6	When they arrived,  Nakehi was not at home.
P7	He had gone out to set a trap to catch a francolin.
P8	When Nakehi returned,  he saw his friends. He was so happy.
P9	He went to see what his wife was cooking.
P10	She was cooking beans.
P11	                   He kicked over                    the beans                    and stormed out                    of the house.
P12	He told his friends about a trap he had set near a nest of francolin eggs.
P13	As they were talking,  Nakehi heard the sound of the francolin calling. The call told him something.
P14	The bird was caught in the trap!
P15	Nakehi jumped up,  stuck his knife in his belt,  and ran off to catch the francolin.
P16	Trembling with excitement,  he grabbed the francolin in one hand.
P17	           With his other hand he             gathered up the eggs.
P18	Nakehi headed home,  full of pride.
P19	But as he walked,  his knife was cutting away at his belt.
P20	           Proudly Nakehi walked                 up to his house.
P21	At that moment his belt snapped and his loincloth fell to his ankles.
P22	He tried to grab the cloth but let go of the bird.
P23	It flew away. The eggs lay broken on the ground.
P24	           Nipapariya and his wife              laughed and laughed.
P25	Then they all ate what was left of the beans.
