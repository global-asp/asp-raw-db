The loneliest skeleton is about a lonely skeletons journey to find love

page_text:

P1	There once was a cold lonely skeleton
P2	He rattled and rattled and rattled so loud that he made all the town's people say get out of here right now!
P3	So the cold lonely skeleton could never stay long
P4	He just rattled and walked and rattled and walked and rattled and walked even more
P5	The cold lonely skeleton feared for the worst how long would it be that he would wander this earth
P6	From town to town with no kindness in sight
P7	But a small girl named Ava did not think that this was right
P8	So she put out her arms and gave him a hug
P9	This was not just any ordinary hug
P10	This was a big warm hug full of kindness and love. @ðŸ’—
P11	It warmed the cold lonely skeleton inside and out
P12	And finally the cold lonely skeleton found a home and he would never again have to be cold and alone
