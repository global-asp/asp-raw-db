page_text:

P1	As the mother continent and first inhabited region on earth, Africa is characterized by vast lands and one of the largest populations on the planet with rich human heritage and cultural diversity.
P2	The broad history of Africa tells the world about the story of her civilizations ranging from the first artists that left impressions on their rock shelters to the scholars who built great universities in the Sahara.
P3	Africa’s rich history and culture are so diverse that it varies not only from one country to another but also within regions and countries. The culture of each ethnic group holds together the authentic social fabric of traditional practices
P4	Also our rites, art, music, and oral literature through which identities are built. As such, diversity of cultures, religions, languages, and traditions should not be addressed as a barrier to development.
P5	The continent should take advantage and build on this rich diversity in its quest for prosperity and change of the attitudes of its people towards issues related to economic growth, social development, and relation with the environment
P6	The collective consciousness of opportunities towards the potential of African cultural resources can go a long way in reinforcing pride and confidence in local products as well as triggering innovation and creativity.
P7	African traditional beliefs, environmental ethics, and socio-cultural practices in the conservation of natural resources can contribute to addressing the global questions of biodiversity conservation and environmental rehabilitation.
P8	Apart from economic aspects, African communities have a close and intimate cultural connection with their lands, forests, trees, and surrounding biodiversity.
P9	Over time, Africans have developed elaborate and resilient traditions associated with the conservation and management of environmental resources. This is our Heritage
P10	Throughout the entire history of slavery in North America, individuals who spoke African languages and could personally remember another life on that distant continent mingled with others who were at least a generation or two.
P11	sometimes several generations—removed from that experience. The number of actual Africans varied in different eras, of course, and there were proportionately very few by the time the peculiar institution ended.
P12	It is also important to ask about what is meant by the term African to begin with. The word does not and never has indicated a nationality; Africa is and was a land of many different peoples, tongues, and cultures.
P13	Heritages are unique and cherished characteristics or features of a society that are passed down through generations via deliberate efforts of preservation. Heritages do not die, rather it lives for the present and future.
P14	Africa is a continent endowed with a lot of cultural heritages.
P15	In Africa, cultural heritages are those original or ingenious activities, experiences, events that are preserved and transmitted through oral tradition or in a written concrete form that are passed down across generations of human society.
P16	Traditions like tales/dance by the moonlight, adages, lullabies, poems/proverbs, riddles, incantations, and other unique activities make for cultural heritage in Africa.
P17	In Kati, Mali to be precise, when a horse is beaten by illness and cannot stand, it suffices for a woman who has known only one man in her whole life to jump over the horse and it will get healed.
P18	This cultural practice has been with them from time and it has proven to them to have efficacy without any empirical or scientific justification.
P19	Uganda’s Ekyogero traditional herbal bath is another prominent culture in Africa. It is a popular bath for newborn babies in many communities in Uganda and it is more common among tribes from central, western, and south-western Uganda.
P20	According to the culture, it makes the child strong and healthy physically. It is also a herbal bath that is used to cleanse and give the baby smooth skin and it is also believed to bring good luck to the body and wade off curses.
P21	This shows the strength and willpower that they have kept in touch with their roots. It is beloved that modern medicines do not have answers to everything, and it was from the application of herbs they also got modern medicine from.
P22	The Wodaabe people of Niger have been called “the vainest people in the world”. Mette Bovin writes that the first thing a Wodaabe man does when he wakes, is the first thing a young man of the Wodaabe does in the morning
P23	He is look into his small mirror, to check and tidy up his face… he will not even go out among the cows without his morning ritual’.
P24	What is even more unique about this tribe is the Guérewol competition. It is an annual marriage competition that has young men dress up with ornaments and face paint thereafter, they dance and sing.
P25	As they dance and sing, they batt their eyes and show off their dentition to look more attractive. They intend to have one of the young girls of marriageable age fall in love with them and their skills.
P26	Spitting is a sign of reverence and respect among the Maasai people of Kenya and Northern Tanzania. It is also seen as a form of greeting in a more positive light.
P27	Spitting has a lot of significance. If the spit is done on the palms and used to shake someone’s hand, it signifies a friendly greeting.
P28	When done on an individual, especially a baby, it means blessings. Also, when a father spits on his daughter on her wedding day, it means prayers and wishes to have a beautiful home.
P29	A person who does not have a foundation (culture) does not know where he or she is going. It is rather sad that some only value their heritage when it is given to them by another who doesn’t understand it but uses it for exploitation.
P30	It is time Africans got back to their roots and rebuild what has been destroyed. We don’t have to throw away, neglect, or abolish all our customs and traditions because of civilization.
P31	Today, virtually the entire world is returning to its traditional ways or ideas. If countries like China, India, Japan who follow their culture are far away better and doing well now.
P32	Then Africa can do so too, because I don’t think civilization is here to change us but we can only partake in it.
