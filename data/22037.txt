page_text:

P1	There were four lambs living in a house with their mother. 

Mother was on her way to the market. "You will open the door only when I say open the door, my children," she warned her lambs.
P2	Meanwhile, a fox was nearby and heard the mother. He went to the house and said, "My children, open the door." 
 
One of the lambs said, "No, that is not our mother's voice. Our mother's voice is soft." The fox was angry.
P3	The fox wanted to make his voice like the lambs' mother. He decided to eat butter. 

He went to a shopkeeper. "Give me some butter, or I will kill you," threatened the fox. 

The shopkeeper gave him butter.
P4	The fox went to the lambs and said, "My children, open the door." A lamb looked through the keyhole of the door and saw the black leg of the fox. 

"No, our mother's legs are red!" shouted the lamb. Fox was not successful.
P5	Fox thought of another way. This time he planned to paint his legs with pepper powder. 

He went to a miller. "Give me pepper powder, or I will eat you," the fox threatened. 

The miller gave him pepper powder.
P6	Fox painted his legs with the powder. He went to the lambs' house and said, "My children open the door." 

The lambs opened the door. Fox swallowed three of them.
P7	The fourth lamb was hiding. 

Mother came back from the market. She said, "My children, I have come. Open the door."  

The fourth lamb was terrified and couldn't open the door for her mother.
P8	When no one opened the door, the mother sheep kicked it open. She called her lambs. 

The fourth lamb came out of hiding. Her mother asked "Where are the others?"
P9	Shivering, the lamb replied, "The fox swallowed the others!"

Her mother said, "The fox might eat us too. Let's move to another place." They set off to another place.
P10	While they were travelling they saw the fox. He was sleeping. 

The mother approached the fox. She heard the voices of her lambs inside the fox's belly. 

"Bring me a razor blade, thread and a needle," said the mother to her lamb.
P11	The mother cut the fox's belly with a razor blade. She found her three lambs inside his belly. 

She filled his belly with stones and stitched it together. She took all her lambs back to their house.
P12	When the fox woke up, he found it very difficult to get up. 

He tried to drink water at a river, but he lost his balance. He fell into the water and drowned.
