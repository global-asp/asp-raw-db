page_text:

P1	Long ago three rats lived in a jungle. @@There was white Rat, Red Rat and Black Rat.
P2	Cat always wanted to eat the three rats. @@But the three rats avoided Cat by sticking together. They also changed the places they frequented.
P3	One day, Cat called White Rat alone and said to him, "It is really shameful to see you as beautiful as you are living with those two ugly rats!"@@After saying this, Cat left and waited for a chance to catch White Rat.
P4	White Rat spent the night contemplating. He thought, "Cat is right. I must stay away from these dirty rats." @@Then, when White Rat was walking alone, Cat caught him and ate him.
P5	As Cat did before, she went to find Red Rat and said, "Miss Red Rat, why is it that you are staying with this ugly creature while you are such a beauty? Think about it!"@@After saying this, Cat left to wait for a chance to catch Red Rat.
P6	Red Rat knew what Cat had said was false and she didn't hate her friend, Black Rat. She thought that Cat wanted to separate them in order to eat them.@@Red Rat decided to stay with her friend, Black Rat more than ever. They planned to run to safety.
P7	Cat waited to find Red Rat alone, but she couldn't. She searched everywhere. She saw Red Rat and Black Rat run and play in a beautiful garden and felt angry. @@She learned that they no longer separated. She went and knelt before them.
P8	She asked them for pardon.
P9	Red Rat and Black Rat pardoned it. @@Cat promised not to harm the two rats. But Red Rat and Black Rat never stayed apart.
P10	Cat felt guilty for eating White Rat.
P11	Do you Red Rat and Black Rat are safe?
