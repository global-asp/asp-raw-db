page_text:

P1	In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. @@In this town there lived a rich man with big feet. @@This is the town in which I was born.
P2	Many people came to the shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. @@The rich man visited the shop twice a year and always bought shoes.
P3	He put his money on the shop counter. @@Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
P4	As he came closer, I lost my breath and froze.@ @He stretched out his hands and grabbed me. @@Then, he sat down and began to put me on each foot.
P5	He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! @@I was packed in a box.@@We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
P6	He wore me every day.@@I made him smart and he walked with confidence. @@I had a hard life with him. He was always lazy about washing his feet!
P7	In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp.@@But eventually, I became old and broken. I had scars and cracks.@@He no longer wore me.
P8	He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.@@A boy picked me up and put me in his recycling bag. I saw joy on his face!
P9	The boy took me to a workshop.@@There, I was patiently made into a shiny new wallet. I began a new life!
