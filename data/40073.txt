page_text:

P1	I woke up at the crack of dawn.I lazily dragged myself out of my king-sized bed.There was no time to waste.We needed to be at the shore fishing.We carried fishing rods,baskets and some money to buy honey.
P2	My brother and I were at the shore fishing.We took out our fishing rods.We caught twelve fish,we sat near the lake.We slit open the fish,cleaned it and lastly salted the fish.
P3	We boarded a matatu and headed home.On the way we alighted to buy a tin of honey.We safely arrived home.What is that mother asked?"It is fish and a tin of sweet honey for you mum," I answered.She took the luggage and thanked us so much.
P4	We collected some firewood  and lit fire to cook the fish.We were careful not to overcook the fish.A sweet aroma could smell in the air as we roasted the fish.The fish was now well cooked and ready for eating.
P5	We served mother,our little siblings and ourselves.It was a delicious meal.After we finished our meals,each of us took a glass of orange juice
P6	It was an enjoyable day that I will never forget.
