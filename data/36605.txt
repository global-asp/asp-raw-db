page_text:

P1	It was on Friday morning in the month of May 2020.@@All schools had been closed for over two months because of the Corona virus.
P2	I was doing house chores when my friends visited me.@@They helped me to finish the work I was doing.
P3	Afterwards, we played outside our small house.@@We lived in a section of Kibera where houses are close together.
P4	The man next-door was living alone since the Corona virus broke out.@@His wife and two children had left for the village.
P5	Children went in and out of the man's house frequently. @@The man invited them to watch Television and to eat sweets.
P6	One day, I noticed him watching me as I washed utensils outside our house.@@Another time as I played with my friends, he mentioned my name.
P7	As I watched TV in the house, he jumped on me and began touching me, "I love you," he told me. @@I pretended that I needed to use the bathroom.
P8	My two girlfriends refused to listen to me. They went to the man's house and received 300 shillings each.@@I decided to report the man so he was arrested. I felt safe again.
