P1	Winter was supposed to end. We had kept away all heating equipment.
P2	Everybody was looking forward to the summer days. Warm and nice. No heavy jackets, boots or scarfs.
P3	It was October and supposed to be begining of summer! But temperatures were too low for that time of year.
P4	We lit candles to warm ourselves. But it was not warm enough.
P5	We bought fancy lamps to warm ourselves. But it was not warm enough.
P6	We checked our wardrobes for heavier jackets.
P7	We brought out our boots again.
P8	We looked for warmer scarfs from everywhere.
