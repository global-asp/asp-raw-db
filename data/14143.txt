page_text:

P1	Long long time ago in the village of Kisaku, there lived a noisy hare called Apwuoyo. He was very lazy and ever stole his neighbor's carrots and sweet potatoes. He did this for several days without being caught by the owner.
P2	Every night, Apwuoyo would creep slowly to his neighbour's garden and steal the carrots. Unluckily, the third time, he found a trap that looked like an animal. He moved closer to it and tried to touch with his left hand.
P3	Apwuoyo was surprised to find himself stuck on the trap. So he tried with his two legs which were stuck too. After sometime, Othimu, the owner of the garden, came to check on his garden. He was amazed to find his neighbour stuck in the trap he had set.
P4	As it was said by the wise man, "A thief's days are numbered." It was the end for Apwouyo. He had to pay for his bad character. That's the end of my story.
