desc:	Elephants once had short noses

page_text:

P1	Everyone knows that the elephant has a very long nose.
P2	But a long time ago,  the elephant's nose was short and fat. Like a shoe in the middle of its face.
P3	One day a baby elephant was born. She was curious about everything. She had a question for every animal.
P4	She was curious about Giraffe. "Why do you have a long neck?" she asked.
P5	She was curious about Rhino. "Why does your horn have a sharp point?"
P6	She was curious about Hippo. "Why do you have red eyes?" she asked.
P7	And she was VERY curious about Crocodile. "What does Crocodile eat for dinner?" she asked.
P8	"Never ask a question like that!" said her mother. Then she walked off,  frowning.
P9	Quickly Crow flew down to baby elephant.  "Follow me to the river. There you will see what Crocodile eats for dinner," squawked Crow.
P10	So the baby elephant followed Crow down to the river.
P11	She pushed through the reeds and stood on the bank. She looked into the water. Where was Crocodile?
P12	"Hello," said a stone near the river bank.   "Hello," said Baby Elephant. "Can you tell me what Crocodile eats for dinner?" she asked.
P13	"Bend down and I will tell you," said the stone. "Lower,  lower," said the stone.   So Baby Elephant bent down lower,  and lower.
P14	Then suddenly,  "Snap!" Baby Elephant's nose was caught in Crocodile's jaws.    "Crocodile will eat you for dinner!" squawked Crow,  and flew away.
P15	Baby Elephant sat back on her strong legs and pulled. She pulled,  and pulled.   But Crocodile did not let go of her nose.
P16	Baby Elephant's nose stretched,  and stretched,  and stretched.   Then,  "Thud!" she fell on her back.
P17	Crocodile sunk back into the water. He was cross about losing his dinner.
P18	Baby Elephant looked at her nose.    It was stretched very long. She could not see where it ended!
P19	Her nose was so long she could pick fruit from high branches.
P20	Her nose was so long she could shower her back with water. From that day,  all elephants had long and useful trunks.
