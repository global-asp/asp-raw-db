page_text:

P1	One day my parents went out and left me at home.
P2	I started eating everything in the house.
P3	A bird came through the window.
P4	I ran to the toilet and didn't feel like eating anymore.
P5	When my brother came back and saw the bird staring at him, he was very angry.
P6	He killed the bird and threw it away.
P7	Then he was hungry. He didn't find any food in the pot.
P8	He beat me and then he went to fetch my mom from where she was selling.
P9	I told her what happened. My mother beat me again.
P10	That night I did not eat with my family. I went to bed hungry.
