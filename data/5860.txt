page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived three girls in a desert village in the Kalahari. Katitu Momambo was the youngest of the three. She was small but clever and wise. The big girls went into the veld one day to gather food and wood. Little Katitu ran after them,  but the sisters sent her back. "Go back Katitu! You are too small to go with us! Stay at home!" they said. Katitu followed them from a distance.
P2	When they noticed her,  they were too far away from home to send her back,  so she joined them. While she was walking behind them,  Katitu cut herself some wood. She made herself a bow and many arrows. The girls walked and walked and walked until the sun dropped into the Kalahari horizon. They were lost. They walked into a deserted village and found a hut in which to spend the night.
P3	An old woman was sitting next to the hut. Little Katitu went and greeted her. "Oh?" answered the old woman,  "This is the village of the Big Snake! He stays in a big hole in the cattle kraal. When people come to milk the cows,  he eats them! He will go to your hut at night when you sleep and kill you there!"
P4	"Hai,  gom-gom,  hai,  gom-gom,  where are they?" sang the Big Snake. The little clever girl answered him with a chant,  "Here they are,  here they are!" Then the Big Snake rushed against the hard skin at the door of the hut. Little Katitu shot an arrow through the hole in the skin. Yes,  the little girl killed the Big Snake.
P5	Then Katitu woke up the older girls. "Sister,  sister,  sister," she whispered,  "get up,  get up,  get up!"
P6	And when the girls woke up they saw a big snake lying there. "Come,  we have to take him back to his hole!" shouted Katitu. They rolled him up,  rolled him up,  rolled him up and they set him right back in his hole. "Hurry! We have to run!" And the girls ran and ran and ran.
P7	The girls continued to run and were very tired and thirsty. Eventually,  they saw a waterhole! None of older sisters wanted to scoop the water from the deep well. They asked Katitu to climb in as she was the smallest. "Will you help me out of the well if I climb into it?" asked Katitu. "Yes," they replied,  "we will help you." Katitu went into the well and scooped water for her sisters.
P8	Each girl drank and then walked away. They all left Katitu in the deep well and walked home. Later that evening,  the elephants came to drink. One of them drank and left. Another one drank and left. The last elephant drank and swallowed Katitu with the water! A few drops of Katitu's blood sprayed onto the reeds growing at the water hole.
P9	Katitu's father called the young men of the homestead and ordered them to find the tracks of the elephants and find Katitu. The young men hurried off. They met the first group of elephants and asked them,  "Elephants,  elephants,  have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?" And the elephants sang: "!a plaf!a plaf! We trot lightly. We are so light,  we carry nothing!" And they passed on.
P10	The young men met up with an old elephant in the bush and asked,  "Old elephant,  elephant,  have you seen the one who swallowed our girl?"
P11	The old elephant sang: "!a plaf!a plaf! I trot lightly! I am so light,  I carry nothing!" But now the young men heard a little voice in the belly of the elephant. "Cut him open! Go on,  cut him on his left side,  for I am sitting on his left side!" said the voice.
