page_text:

P1	A bus driver in Kano once picked up three passengers to Sabon Gari Market. @@They were Dog, Goat and Sheep.
P2	Dog, Goat and Sheep went to the market to buy different items to make soup for their families.
P3	Goat bought vegetables, Sheep bought maize and Dog bought some meat.
P4	The driver asked them to hurry up or else he would leave them behind.
P5	On the way back from the market, Sheep was the first to get off from the bus. @@She did not pay and went away.
P6	At the second bus stop, Goat also got down but did not pay. @@She ran away.
P7	At the last bus stop, Dog got down and paid. @@The driver refused to give her any change. "You have paid for your two friends," the driver said.
P8	Busses in Kano no longer carry goats and sheep because they will run away without paying the fare. @@Dogs always bark and pursue busses to collect their grandmother's change.
