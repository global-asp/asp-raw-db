page_text:

P1	My mom got me two puppies.@@They were so cute!
P2	I decided to name them Royalty and Blackie.
P3	Royalty was brown and like a queen. @@Blackie was a lovely black dog with long hair.
P4	I used to walk them everyday when I came from school.
P5	Sometimes I would bath them by myself. @@Royalty would always run away!
P6	Then, we moved and went to a flat. @@They didn't allow dogs there.
P7	We left Blackie and Royalty with my cousins.@@One morning, I decided to visit my dogs.
P8	I found that Blackie was lost, and Royalty was lonely. @@ I felt very bad in my heart.
