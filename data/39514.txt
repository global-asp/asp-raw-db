page_text:

P1	One day, the animals gathered for a meeting to elect their new king.
P2	"Let's do a contest to choose our new king." Said the leopard.
P3	Elephant suggested that, "whoever throws the spear the farthest wins." Everyone agreed.
P4	"I'll go first," said the Elephant. Using all his might, he threw the spear into the air.
P5	Next came the Baboon.
P6	"I'll go next." Said Warthog.
P7	Deer was the last to throw the spear. He threw it so far away that it took the animals four days to find the spear.
P8	And that was how Deer became the new king.
