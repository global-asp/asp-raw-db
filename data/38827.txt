P5	"Shame on you! I am walking slow because my body is heavy, I am built with a lot of expensive material, I am high and I am bigger than you." Mansion replied.
P6	"Hooolah! Do not think you are better than me, I am short and built of cheap material and few material but most traditional people like me because I am very cool in Summer and very warm in Winter".  Hut replied.
P7	" Ha! Ha! Ha!, Modern people also like me". They open my big windows and big doors in Summer to cool themselves, close them in Winter and light heaters to warm the whole house and themselves."   Mansion replied.
P8	Hut laughed, "He! He! He!, you see my friend, we are both liked by people". "Ouch! Look there under the tree, Shack is sitting under the tree bleeding". They ran to the tree and took him home. Shack thanked Mension and Hut for helping him.
