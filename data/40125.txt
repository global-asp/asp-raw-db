P1	One day, Musa and Ibrahim were walking to the farm holding a basket of food
P2	All of a sudden, a big black monkey jumped out of the bush and got them scared.
P3	The monkey threatens them, and asks them to drop down the basket of foot for him, else, it will bite them.
P4	They became very afraid and kept down the basket for the monkey. They ran back home and reported what had happened to their father.
P5	Their father thought of what to do and he got a brilliant idea. He gave them another basket, hidding a wicket dog instead of food inside it. On their way back to the farm, the monkey jumpa out of the bush  and tries to scare them once more.
P6	This time around, the two brothers willingly and happily gave out the basket to the monkey without any hesitation.
P7	After collecting the basket, the black monkey opened it expecting to see food. Surprisingly to him however, a big dog jumped out of the basket and started barking and biting his hand while he tries to run for his life.
P8	That is how the two brothers went back home feeling satisfied that, the monkey had learnt his lesson.
