page_text:

P1	Luisa and her mother go to the market. "Mom,  can you buy candy?" asked Luisa. "We will buy what we need to make good food,  healthy food," replies mother.
P2	"We will only buy healthy foods?" asks Luisa  "That's right. First we will buy flour to make xima," says mother. "I know. The xima gives strength and energy to play and study!" replies Luisa.
P3	They bought flour. Luisa sees peanuts. "Mom,  there are peanuts. Are we going to buy peanuts?" she asks "Yes," answers mother. "Peanuts help our bodies to grow,  they help the bones and muscles to stay strong."
P4	They buy peanuts. Luisa sees cassava. "Mom,  is cassava healthy?" asks Luisa. "Yes,  but we have cassava at home. We do not need to buy any. We need green leaves to make matapa," replies mother.
P5	Luisa soon finds green leaves and shows them to her mother. As they shop,  mother explains,  "Green leaves are very good to defend our bodies from colds and other illnesses."
P6	"Is that why we make matapa so often?" asks Luisa. "Yes!" replies mother,  "we need more of the food that protects us from disease. We must eat tomatoes,  carrots,  garlic and onions."
P7	"For bones and muscles,  do we just eat peanuts?" Luisa wants to know. "We will also buy a chicken," replies mother.  While buying chicken,  Luisa sees sweet potatoes. She is very fond of sweet potatoes.
P8	"Mom,  will you buy sweet potatoes?" asks Luisa. "At school the teacher said that they are a healthy food!" Mother smiles,  "It is true. They give energy and vitamins. They are also very tasty. Let's buy some."
P9	"And now let's go home. We have to cook," says mother. "Let's go!" Luisa agrees. She enjoys helping her mother to cook. "We will prepare a very healthy meal," says Luisa.
