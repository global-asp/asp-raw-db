P1	Once upon a time there was a fairy she used to tell people things, then at the end of the day she will tell lies or scare the person. One day she met an old lady in a hut she fairy told her that the old lady would be rich in the evening.
P2	After telling the old lady this she went outside and looked inside and saw the old lady. The old lady saw the fairy and asked her, you said I will be rich it's a matter of patience my dear old lady before you'll know it you will be rich.
P3	Hello my dearest old lady your new house is ready bigger than this one then we must be going! said the old lady excited. She ran out of her housee and told the fairy that if she was lying she will report to the village head she ran fast.
P4	The old lady was fascinated and before her there was a table a bed two pots and a VERY comfy chair she called the fairy is this the house? yes it is but don't worry there is a another house just for you just be patient and I will tell you.
P5	Fairy why do I have to wait? said the old lady impatiently it's because patience can led to fortune well...... if that's the case I'll tell the village head lies in order for you to be locked up I will guide you to the house tomorrow okay!.
P6	The next day the fairy came back and said your final house is ready then what are we waiting for let's go the old lady was so greedy. She rushed and she ran and ran and ran and the fairy said be patient we're almost there here we are.
P7	The old lady was fascinated and before her there was a chair a dining table dining seats 3 bedrooms and a big bathroom the old lady still wasn't satisfied she stayed at that house for one day and she ate delicious food she hated the place.
P8	The old lady was very greedy and the fairy warned her that this greediness would make her transport back to the small hut she didn't believe the fairy and she made a mockery out of the fairy's magic and she said "you are a useless fairy!".
