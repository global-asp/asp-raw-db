P2	Ostrich fed her chicks well.
P3	The cubs had little food to eat.
P4	Lioness looked at the chicks and thought,  "They are beautiful! I wish they were mine."
P5	When Ostrich was away,  Lioness took the chicks to her home.
P6	Ostrich returned and found the cubs in her home. She cried,  "Where are my children?"
P7	Ostrich ran to Lioness' hut and saw her chicks with Lioness.
P8	Lioness refused to let Ostrich take her chicks. She said,  "They are mine now. You can have the cubs."
P9	Ostrich was angry and upset. "What can I do to get back my children?" she wondered to herself.
P10	Then she thought,  "I know what to do. I will call all the animals for a meeting."
P11	The animals gathered together.
P12	Elephant asked Ostrich and Lioness to speak.
P13	Most of the animals were afraid to blame Lioness.
P14	Finally,  Squirrel stood up and said,  "Children that look like birds,  belong to Ostrich. Those with tails,  belong to Lioness."
P15	Then Squirrel disappeared into a hole. All the animals cheered.
P16	Lioness was very annoyed. She went home with her cubs.
