P1	I had never worn shoes before. When I saw children wearing nice shoes,  I would look at them with longing. Naali si nambalangaho ngayito nayire. Ninawonanga abaana nibambaye ngambengomba.
P2	Maama galomanga ati ''oja huba n'emigogo jinyi eyiwujaho eyo, linda hyoka!'' Sinefugiringa ebigandomanga. Lulala namuwusaho ti.''eyiwujaho eyo nje aŋaali?''.
P3	Ebiseera byabita nga kusimamasi esemberera. Abaatu abatiinanga mu katale bagaluhanga na maboŋo ge biitu ebinyaha. Nga muwusa ti ''maama, hu tiina mu katale?''.
P4	Ku wuhye hu kurisimasi maama gasisimusa mu mawiwi kitali hyawulijo. Gandoma pambe ogusero ogubba ogohuguliramo ebiitu.
P5	 Mu katale mwalimo abasaye bangi n'abaana bawe ni bagula engoye epyaha n'emere.
P6	We went straight to where there were many different types of shoes. Hwaŋabirira hwatiina aŋabali ni batunda engayito enjenjawulo n'enjawulo. Nasamiriye nahengera hiisi lulayini olubali nibanyire aŋo.
P7	After trying on many pairs,  I settled for black lace-up shoes. At home that night,  I couldn't sleep. I was so excited thinking of how I would wear my new shoes and show off to every child in the village.
P8	After a while,  I got out of bed and put on the shoes. I walked slowly around the room and then put the shoes back into the box. I lay down again,  but I couldn't sleep.
P9	I got up and tried on the shoes a second time. I strutted around the room for a while and then put them back.
P10	I lay down once more and tried to sleep. But I got up a third time. I put on the shoes and jumped around the room. Then I felt tired. I decided to get back into bed.
P11	Nibuhyeye maama gasisimusa, Gawuusa ati''hyina hino ehimbona?''.
P12	Naali penyuhire ne engato ni jiri mu magulu hu wuliri.
