page_text:

P1	Manuel is very fond of trees. He writes what everyone says about the trees. "Trees are very important. Trees clean the air for us to breathe," says the teacher. "When a site is treeless,  there is no rain and everything is dry. When everything is dry,  it is difficult to grow food and people starve," says the farmer.
P2	Grandpa says,  "The tree casts a shadow,  bears fruit and medicines. We make our homes with wood from the trees." Mother says,  "The tree roots hold the soil when there is rain and floods. The tree protects the houses and crops from strong winds."
P3	Manuel likes trees. He knows that a tree is home to many animals. One day,  the teacher said,  "Boys and girls,  today we will make a drawing of a tree. Then we are going to write why the tree is important."
P4	Manuel is happy and draws a beautiful tree. He writes what the teacher,  farmer grandfather,  and mother had said about trees. Manuel has not forgotten anything. He likes trees a lot.
P5	One day,  Manuel sees Mr John Salimo cutting a tree. Manuel runs to tell his mother. Mother explains to Manuel,  "The city needs wood,  firewood and coal. People make money by selling these products."
P6	Manuel is sad. He is worried that people will use up the land's resources. If that happens,  we will have no food. Manuel had an idea. He spoke to the teacher,  "Teacher,  they are cutting down all the trees. We need to have a meeting to teach parents that trees are important."
P7	The teacher agrees,  "It is important to warn people." In class,  the teacher says,  "Manuel wants to show parents why trees are important." He asks the class to write a poem to recite at the meeting. On the day of the meeting,  Manuel explains everything so well that the parents clap.
P8	At the end of the meeting,  the boys and girls of Manuel's class recite their poem. The poem says: Trees are our friends. Without the trees,  we can not live. All parents listen to everything very carefully. Then parents decide,  "Let's plant trees everywhere."
P9	The boys and girls of Manuel's class ask the teacher,  "We want to plant trees. We do not want to live in a land without trees." The teacher agrees,  "We will work with the parents. Let's all plant trees!"
