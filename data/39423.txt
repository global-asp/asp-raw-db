page_text:

P1	Dad has really long legs.
P2	In fact, they are soo long, he doesn't fit in his bed!
P3	When we go for a bike ride, he can't sit properly. @@Poor dad!
P4	So I had an idea. I bought dad a new bed with my pocket money. @@After a hard day's work, he had such a cozy night's rest!
P5	I had saved up enough money.@@After a few weeks, I bought a new, shiny, lovely bike! We played on it all day!
P6	Dad was comfortable talking to a crow of kids.
P7	I had also noticed that dad had difficult using a hoe.@@So I saved enough and bought him a hoe he could use comfortably.
P8	I always made sure that he was happy.
