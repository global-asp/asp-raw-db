page_text:

P1	Circle the Lion lives in the world of circles.
P2	He drinks from the round waterhole.@@He plays with round stones.@@He sleeps under round rocks. @He dreams about round friends.
P3	Circle the Lion feels alone in his round world.@@He leaves his round home to find a similar friend, a friend that looks like him.
P4	Behind the big round bush, he finds a new world.
P5	One animal sits in front of a house.@@Circle the Lion: “Hello, where am I?”@@Cat: “Hi, this is our world full of triangles.”@@Circle the Lion: “Really, nothing is round?”@@Cat: “No, we love our angles. Look, we all have three angles.
P6	Circle the Lion: “Nice to meet you, but I am looking for a friend with no angles. Do you know another world?”@@Cat: “Yes, on top of the mountain you will find a new world.”
P7	Circle the lion enters the new world. Even@ from far away, he can already see a lot of@ animals. He is very excited.
P8	Circle the Lion: “Where am I?”@@Elephant: “Hi, this is our world of rectangles.”@@Circle the Lion: “Really, nothing is round?”@@Giraffe: “No, we love our angles. Look, we all have four angles.”
P9	Circle the Lion: “Nice to meet you. Do you know another world?”@@Snake: “Why? You can play with us.”@@Circle the Lion: “No. I am looking for a friend who is the same shape. My friend should have no angles.”
P10	Circle the Lion sadly walks away. He leaves sad triangles and rectangles behind.
P11	He has no idea where to find a round friend.@@Tired from his search he takes a break under a tree.
P12	Leopard: “Yoohoo, who are you? What are you doing?”@Circle the Lion: “I am Circle the Lion. I am looking for a round friend to play with. But I only found triangles and rectangles. Can you help me?”
P13	Leopard: “I have a lot of circles on my fur. Can we play together?”@Circle the Lion: “Oh, good idea! You look like a perfect round friend.”@Circle the Lion and the leopard with his circles play together for a long time.
P14	One day they get a little bored. They have only each other and only circles to play with.@@Leopard: “It would be fun to play with others.”@@Circle the Lion: “Do you remember what I told you about the other worlds?“
P15	Leopard: “You mean the worlds of triangles and rectangles?”@@Circle the Lion: “Yes, we could try to play with them.”@@Leopard: “Good idea! Let us have a party.”
P16	The leopard writes an invitation@ to all shapes.
P17	All animals with different shapes come to the party.@@Mouse: “Hey Circle the lion, look what we found out! We can also be a circle.”@@Snake: “I can be a circle too.”@@Circle the Lion: “Oh wow, that is so cool.”
P18	The animals quickly realise that they can form different shapes when they are together.
