page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  a long time ago,  there was a time of great hunger. A very smart hyena pretended he was so sick he couldn't even go out.
P2	Lots of animals went to visit him in his home to comfort him. But none of them ever came out!
P3	One beautiful afternoon,  the rabbit arrived. He thought he would like to visit the hyena too.
P4	He almost went into the hyena's cave. But suddenly he stopped,  and saw there were only tracks of animals going in,  and none coming out.
P5	So he stayed outside and shouted into it,  "How are you? Are you healthy,  my best friend? Are you getting better?"
P6	The hyena answered,  "Don't worry,  my friend. Come in and give me some lovely company!"
P7	"You are lying! I can see the footprints of animals that have gone in but haven't come out."
P8	The hyena went quiet and the rabbit said,  "Good-bye,  my friend,  I think I will visit you another day."
P9	And the rabbit ran far away from that place!
