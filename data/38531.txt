P2	One day a monkey saw eggs on the road.
P3	Who's eggs are this? Monkey asked. They are mine said the mosquito.
P4	Please no one should step in them. They will only be there for a few days. Please look after them I am going to look for a better place for them asked mosquit, Monkey agreed.
P5	All animals did not step on them, until one day an elephant came. Monkey told the elephant not to step on the eggs.
P6	The elephant did not listen. He undermined the mosquito because he was a small animal.
P7	Mosquito returned, to his surprise eggs were broken and the monkey told him that the elephant did step on the eggs.
P8	Mosquito was heart broken. He went to the elephant to ask what happened. Why did you break my eggs? asked mosquito.
