P1	There is a school in Randburg, the very best that can be.@It's name is IR Griffith, for short we call it IRG.
P2	It's there that we learn to read and write, count colour in and spell.@PT, swimming and extramurals we do there as well!
P3	The principal is Mrs Lopes, she is fantastic you see.@And all the teachers are AMAZING, the best in the whole country.
P4	I wake up every morning and can't wait to go to school.@To see my friends and learn things new, how absolutely cool!
P5	There is a huge field to play on, a pool and jungle gyms too.@We can run around and be ourselves and we never feel blue.
P6	We wear our uniform with pride and smile from ear to ear.@Because we know at IRG we grow smarter every year.
P7	We also have an aftercare that cares for us, how swell!@They help us with our homework and feed us yummy food as well.
P8	IRG is the best, the VERY best you see.@A home away from home, full of love just for you and me.
