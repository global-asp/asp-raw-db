page_text:

P1	Many people in this village were living in poverty.
P2	Chief Kyemba,  their leader,  advised them,  "Look for the wealth in the soil." But they did not understand and did not pay attention to his words.
P3	A small boy called Mutaka lived in this village. Mutaka caught a lot of birds. He used to eat the whole bird. He even ate the liver and intestines.
P4	One day Mutaka caught a dove in a tree. When the dove saw that Mutaka had him,  it cried out,  "My friend,  leave me and I tell you what you need to know."
P5	Mutaka said,  "Tell me. Then I will eat you!"
P6	The dove spoke while changing its colour from grey to purple. "Let me go to that tree over there,  and then I will tell you more."
P7	Mutaka let the dove go and it flew to the tree. When it reached there,  it laughed at Mutaka. "Wealth is in meee!" called the dove.
P8	Mutaka asked,  "What are you saying?" "Inside me is gold!" replied the bird. "You were stupid to release me. You have missed a lot of wealth," the dove tormented Mutaka.
P9	Then the bird passed out droppings that looked like gold. It flew to a taller tree. Mutaka started to scratch the ground around the tree.
P10	He called out to the villagers,  "Come with me,  we can all scratch for wealth in the ground."
P11	The dove continues to sing in the tree that,  "Wealth is in meee!"
