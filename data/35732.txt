P1	This is Boom the Tree. You say his name like this... bwoom. Got it? Good.
P2	Everyone loves Boom. But he is sad. You see, Boom the Tree can't see.
P3	His friends ask him why he is sad. He tells them he wants to see.
P4	His friends make a plan... perhaps he will see after all.
P5	They play the most beautiful music. Boom grows tall with joy.
P6	"I see we can see with more than our eyes," Boom the Tree says.
