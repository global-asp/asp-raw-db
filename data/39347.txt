desc:	This storybook narrates what lunchtime of horses in Ethiopia looks like.

page_text:

P1	In Ethiopia, horses work all day, every day including on Sundays. Sometimes lunch is skipped. @@When they have it, most of them eat it while working. This could be until the driver has lunch and comes back. Their eyes could be blindfolded with a sack.
P2	The horses carry all sorts of loads the whole day running long distances. Even they carry waste from the slaughterhouse. @@Lunchtime is also dangerous because the horses eat on the roadside. They can easily be hit by vehicles!
P3	The food they eat is not adequate for the heavy tasks they do. @@They toil in silence beside one another.
P4	People who pass by do not seem to give them attention. @@No one challenges the owner to be considerate and sympathetic.
P5	Lunchtime is work time and Sunday is work day. This should have been their day-off! @@Horses are miserable beasts of burden in this country.
