page_text:

P1	One sunny morning, little Rickus came down for breakfast. As they live on a farm, his mother asked if he did his chores. Still half asleep, little Rickus said "Not yet". His mother then said, "No breakfast until you finish your chores".
P2	As grumpy as can be, little Rickus stomped outside to feed the chickens. Out of frustration, he kicked a chicken. It was the chickens fault he couldn't have breakfast!
P3	Next he went to feed the pigs. Being his grumpy old self, he kicked a pig and yelled "I'm hungry too!". Poor piggy didn't know what was going on with little Rickus.
P4	Last he fed and milked the cows, while feeding the cows, he decided to kick the cow too. After all, it was because of the animals that he couldn't have his breakfast!
P5	"Phew!, All that work made my tummy rumble", thought little Rickus. So off he went to have his breakfast. As he sat down at the kitchen table, his mother gave him a dry bowl of cereal. Confused, he asked: "Where is my milk, bacon and eggs"?
P6	"Well", his mother said, "I saw you kicking the chicken, so no eggs for you for a week. I saw you kicking the pig, so no bacon either and I also saw you kicking the cow, so no milk for you"!
P7	Ashamed for his behaviour and being so mean, he immediately apologized to his mother and promised to never do it again! What would he do without his favourite breakfast of milk, bacon and eggs!
P8	From that day on little Rickus vowed to treat the farm animals with love and respect. He took care of the animals just like they took care of him.
