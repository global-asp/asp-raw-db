P1	Deep in the forest there is a little house.In the house there lives a dog, a cat and a mouse.  The dog and the cat had an agreement, the dog will guard the house from the outside and the cat will guard the house from the inside.
P2	The mouse was not seen as a guardian, but rather as a pest.  The cat lived in luxury inside the house, with a fat belly and a warm bed while the poor dog outside had to struggle with the cold nights and only a few old bones for food.
P3	One day while the dog was sleeping under the apple tree, the cat was chasing the mouse inside the house.  The mouse decided to do a runner and was out the front door with the grumpy cat behind.
P4	The mouse was so frightened by the cat chasing him that he ran past the dog's nose.  He did not even realize he was running past the dog, not until the dog lifted its massive paw and pinned the mouse to the ground.
P5	The mouse knew the end was in sight, he pleaded that the dog shouldn't hurt him and should please release him. The grumpy cat told the dog " kill him" but the poor dog saw the fear in the mouse's eyes and couldn't get it over his heart.
P6	That night the mouse decided to look out of the kitchen window while looking for food, he saw the dog chewing on the old bones in the cold.  He felt sorry for the dog.  The mouse then thought back to how the dog saved his life that day.
P7	He then decided to take food and and also a small blanket for the dog.  The dog was very happy and thankful for the food and blanket that the mouse brought him.
P8	He slept that night with a nice full stomach under a nice warm blanket.@That day the dog learned a very important lesson.  He learned a little bit of kindness can make one get far in life.
P9	From that day on, the mouse took food for the dog every night and the dog always protected the mouse from the nasty cat.  So they protected each other and became some of the best friends under the sun.
