page_text:

P1	a queen named Leo-Pard, tried oh so hard~@but she found it had been a very long while- before she could truly smile.@it took time for her to know- she never wanted it to show~@she didn't want to hide- the sad she felt inside.
P2	a labyrinth of trees set at her paws, she saw at a distance friends and applause@but where she sat upon her throne, she felt alone.@cried~ every other day, wishing her sadness would go away. @she knew it was even worse. there was a curse.
P3	for in the heart of the labyrinth there lived:@ghastly ghostly gregariously growing gnashing gnawing gelded groups
P4	grappling ganglions garnered great gains
P5	on, off, & over, overt oily ogres oozed,
P6	optical operettas onto oba.
P7	Queen Leo-Pard wanted to make changes for the better good@she spoke aloud to the neighborhood.@what's the way this curse will lift?@"drift together and together we must drift!@you all must understand@you NEED to come together for the land!"
P8	she stood on Cush rock, holding the stymphalian steel and told the court just what was the deal.@"I know!" she said in jest, "let's have a spelling contest!"
P9	but seriously though, all kidding aside@who would like to swallow their pride@and speak from their heart@healing words paired with skillful art.@who will step forward and take the chance @of speaking your words and throwing the lance?
P10	everyone full well knew, what exactly that sceptor would do.@it wasn't made for fighting, it was made for righting.@it was made to show the way,@through all the ca-ca people say.@it was like Thor's hammer,@but, you had to add the stammer.
P11	Ele-Phant- couldn't hold her rant. @she burst right through the crowd@blazenly saying aloud,@"I have the right to set it forthe, it is written in the Book of Tothe! @let me have it- i'll say it- you'll see,@i'm the one that holds the key!"
P12	Ele charged- wound up trunk.@Leo-Pard looked- admired her spunk.@that got the best of Ele, in her glory she couldn't tell- @she didn't see- she hurt her baby. @she almost did in, her own kin!@not making careful moves with her groovy groove.
P13	the War-Thog volunteered next and the confusion spread,@everyone reached for their head.@the crowd- mesmerized@Ele- just cried.@~but her baby was safe on the hide of the pride!@Leo-Pard- in protective stance,@saw the trajectory of the lance
P14	Leo-Pard was calming the hood down,@when a gust of wind nearly knocked off her crown!@without hesitation- full steam ahead,@the A-pe- didn't wait- jumped on the sceptor instead.@he threw it with all his might@but, he too took flight!
P15	"no! no! this is no good! I thought you understood?@we need you to be stable, if you're able.@you don't have to keep both feet on the ground,@but, geeeeez louise, don't take flight and be unsound!@thank you A-pe, now please sit down."
P16	Leo-Pard sat and tried not to get upset, after all she wanted to smile.@"Is there anyone else willing for trial?"@with that, the common and dutiful Im-Pala leaped from the pile,@with an anti-aggressive, anti-predatory style.
P17	Im-Pala held the sceptor@and gracefully extended his leg so slender.@he released the stymphalian steel from his hoof@and nearly blew off the house's roof!@as he did he decisively said,@"no this, no that, let's do the middle way instead!"
P18	Leo-pard jumped up completley ecstatic@excited to clear cobwebbs from the attic.@she said, "the sceptor claimed Im-pala the winner-@lets give her an honorary dinner!"@most agreed- some were filled with rust. @-a new way, they did not trust.
P19	meanwhile,@@around and above, all acted appalled
P20	Leo-Pard settled the crowd- she understood.@"a new, middle way is hard for the hood ~ but we can make this good!@Im-pala's talent is just~supernatural~ @and this what we need~ to defeat the shrill@of those that stoop@with ghastly group!
P21	with wonder, want, and wander
P22	all abated.
P23	and then the bell rung -the yin and yang.  @and all in the hood sang.    @the yappers yelled and yakked @but nothing could give them back,@the power to attack.
P24	Leo-Pard declared success- she could see the forest!@Im-Pala cleared the maze- and lifted the optic haze.@the yakkers left the space- to try to save face.@now, in the hood, it's all good.@they became truly free~ from there on to eternity.
