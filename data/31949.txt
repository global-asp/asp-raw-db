page_text:

P1	Many years ago, hyenas were starving. Because of a famine, even goats, sheep and cows migrated to other places. Hyenas had nothing to eat.@@They gathered in one place to discuss the issue.
P2	One of the hyenas said, "In our culture, we eat anything that is fleeing. Look, these clouds are fleeing."@@This hyena believed that the clouds were migrating to another place. He said, "Let's eat them."
P3	Immediately, all the hyenas looked up and saw the clouds moving in the sky. @@One of the youngest hyenas asked, "How do we reach the clouds? They are very far away from the ground."
P4	The oldest hyena said, "Let the strongest hyena stand on the ground and then let the rest of us stand on each other's backs. We will climb on one another's backs until we reach the clouds."
P5	They agreed and started climbing up on one another's backs.@@Soon, there were no more hyenas left remaining on the ground except the strongest one.
P6	After the last hyena climbed up, the hyena on the ground thought that the others had started eating. @@He asked, "Why don't you give me some of the food you're eating?"
P7	However, the hyenas did not reach the clouds. @@They didn't find any food and so they had nothing to give to the strongest hyena standing on the ground.
P8	The strongest hyena became impatient and moved to the left side. All the others came falling down to the right side. @@As a result, even today all hyenas limp on their right side.
