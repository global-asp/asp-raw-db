P1	It was a scorching hot sunny day.@@Dudu and Themba decided to go to the park.@@They bought coldrinks on the way.
P2	Soon they were relaxing on the grass in the shade.@@Dudu was drinking red berry cooldrink. @@Themba was drinking cream soda cooldrink.
P3	They were enjoying being together.@@But their relaxation was disturbed. @@They heard loud voices nearby.
P4	It was two kids arguing.@@The boy wanted to play soccer. @@The girl wanted to swim.
P5	It's so hot, let's cool down!" said the girl.@@The boy was annoyed and began to sulk.@@He kicked his soccer ball high into the air.
P6	The ball fell in the direction of Dudu and Themba.@@It crashed down, hitting their drinks!@@Red and green liquid splashed across Dudu's white shirt.
P7	Themba grabbed the ball, and popped it with his pen knife!@@The boy ran up to Dudu and Themba@@"I am sorry! I am sorry!" he cried.
P8	Dudu scolded, "You caused this mess with your arguing." @@"Being together is more important than the things you DO together," she said.@@And the sun smiled.
