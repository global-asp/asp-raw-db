page_text:

P1	I always wear a mask when I go out.@@A mask protects me. And it protects others.
P2	I wash my hands with soap and water before I leave home.@@And when I arrive home, too.
P3	When I greet my friend, we only touch our elbows!
P4	My grandfather was very sick. He went to hospital.@@Dad called every day for news about grandfather.
P5	Grandfather was fit and healthy before he got sick.@@He got better.
P6	Then, my brother started coughing.@@"My throat is sore," he said.
P7	"Cough into your elbow!" said auntie.@@"Wear a mask. Keep your distance! Stay in your bed!" she told him.
P8	So, my brother stayed in his bed and read.
