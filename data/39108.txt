page_text:

P1	This is the story of a very tall giraffe this giraffe couldn't see the little animals crossing underneath.
P2	The giraffe tripped many humans trying to breed it so one day the indian man had an idea.
P3	He decided to tie the giraffes legs to a tree to stop it from possibly falling or tripping over tiny animals again.
P4	First he tried to grab the giraffe to get its legs easier. But he ended up falling down.
P5	Then he tryed to tie it when it was lying down.
P6	And his idea worked! The giraffe was firmly tightly tied around a tree. So it could never hurt humans or any other animals again.
