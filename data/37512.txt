page_text:

P1	Gummy the Bear sat on the bed in his lovely, little cottage on a bright, sunny morning and looked around. “What am I going to do? Hmmm,I believe I will do nothing." he said. However, after a while, having nothing to do became quite boring.
P2	Gummy felt that doing nothing with a friend would be far more enjoyable, so he dashed over to Little Ted’s home. Little Ted wanted to do nothing with Gummy but first she had to clean her messy room. “I will help you clean.” Gummy offered.
P3	Gummy and Little Ted were finished in no time and sat down to do nothing. However, having nothing to do was still pretty unpleasant. They then strolled over to Orbit the Owl's lair.
P4	“What shall we do?’’ Little Ted asked Orbit who replied with “What about a race up the highest mountain?”. Everyone thought this was a brilliant idea and Orbit offered to be “referee”. They all hurried over to the race’s starting line.
P5	A lot of animals came to see them and give them their support. “On your marks, get set,GOOO!!!” Orbit called out in a loud voice, as Gummy and Little Ted raced up the highest mountain. They ran and climbed and climbed and ran.
P6	The race had just begun, and everybody was shouting,"You will never reach the top of the mountain! Give up! Give up now!”. Little by little Gummy felt disappointed and discouraged. However, Little Ted continued to run.
P7	After repeatedly hearing these negative comments, Gummy decided to drop out of the race. Little Ted continued to run and eventually made it to the top, despite being in great pain. Gummy was blown away and wanted to know how she did it.
P8	Gummy approached her and asked her what her secret is. It was then that he discovered that her secret is to…PLAY DEAF. Play deaf to discouraging words, never give up and always believe in yourself, even if others tell you otherwise.
