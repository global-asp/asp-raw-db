page_text:

P1	In a village, there was a young boy whose name was Abula. @@He did not like to read or even to open a book. He was a lazy pupil. He behaved badly.
P2	Abula stole his mother's money to buy sweets. Even when she hid her money, he found it and took it.@@After eating all his sweets, Abula would play with his friends.
P3	After a while, Abula stopped going to school. He stayed out playing the whole day, only returning home in the evening. @@Abula's mother noticed this and became worried.
P4	"Our son is not behaving well. I do not think he is attending school. He is also stealing money from me," said Abula's mother.@@His father thought about how best to change Abula's behaviour.
P5	He said to his wife, "Next time, hide the money within the pages of a book. He never even opens a book, so the money will be safe there."
P6	The next day, Abula looked for his mother's money. He searched everywhere but he did not find anything. @@He decided to go to the nearest market to find some money.
P7	His father saw where Abula was going. @@"My son, I know why you are going to the market. Now go back inside and look in the books for money," he said.
P8	Abula was puzzled, but he went and searched in the books. @@He found the money that his mother had hidden.
P9	The next day, he looked in the books again. But there was nothing hidden there. @@He went to his father to ask why there was no money in the books.
P10	His father smiled and replied, "My son, do you want to get enough money to buy many sweets?"  @@Abula answered, "Of course, father."
P11	His father said, "Listen to me carefully. Read your books and attend your classes. You will find rewards in books. Do not give up." @@"But father, reading is a difficult activity. Books are boring!" Abula replied.
P12	For a while, Abula's father was quiet. He thought about how to encourage his son. @@Then he said to Abula, "Let us read together. I will help you to find the wealth in books."
