page_text:

P1	In a rural area named Foxville, there lived a little girl called Sibo. @@Sibo stayed with her sick mom and didn't have friends.@@She had an angelic voice. Birds responded to her singing.
P2	Sibo woke up early each morning and sang with the birds in the back yard.@@The dog would try to sing along with them.@@Sibo sang for her mom on happy and sad days.
P3	One morning Sibo woke up and her mom had fallen out of bed. She was very sick. @@Sibo ran outside calling to the neighbour for help.@@But Mrs Tseko ignored her and went inside.
P4	Sibo ran across the street and shouted, "Mr Sithole, please help, my mom is very sick!"@@"Go away, I'm busy," said Mr Sithole.
P5	Sibo kept on running until she came to the tree at the end of the village. She could hear a bird singing a familiar tune.  @@When Sibo stood under the tree, the singing became louder and clearer.
P6	Sibo began to sing along with the bird.@@A sweet voice came from the tree saying, "Sibo, don't worry you're never alone."
P7	The bird flew down from the tree and landed on Sibo's shoulder. @@She had never seen such a beautiful bird before. Its feathers shone and sparkled. She asked the bird, "Who are you?"
P8	Sibo added, "Why are you singing my song?" @@The bird replied, "I am a friend, I can help you. Pull out one feather from my wing and make a wish. @@Sibo gently pulled out a feather, closed her eyes and wished.
P9	Sibo said, "I wish people would help us."@@When she opened her eyes, she saw a beautiful rainbow and sparkles from the wondrous bird. @@The bird said, "Go home, all is well."
P10	Sibo ran home in excitement.@@She found Mr Sithole and Mrs Tseko in her yard.
P11	"We are looking after your mother," said Mrs Tseko with a smile. @@"Come next door and eat with my family," added Mrs Tseko.
P12	Sibo happily joined the Tseko family. @@The magic bird flew over and they all sang together. @@It turned out to be a good day!
