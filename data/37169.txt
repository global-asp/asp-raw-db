page_text:

P1	When you were smiling at me@I smiled back at you as much as it hurt@And you didn't even have shiny teeth@But it was the most beautiful one on Earth@I thought I'd always have you by my side@And i found it wrong when you were dead
P2	There's no point in wish other way@You're always alive smiling in my head
