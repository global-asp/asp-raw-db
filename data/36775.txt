page_text:

P1	In the animal kingdom, there was a mouse family that moved to a new town.There was only one school in that town: Cat School.
P2	There were only cats in there, you could tell by the name of the school. The only child in the mouse family was Jerry. He had no choice but go to the Cat School.
P3	The Cat School had never had a student who wasn't a cat. The first day of school was really lame for Jerry - no one talked to him, not even the teacher.
P4	But it was not their fault. Everybody knows cats and mice are natural enemies.
P5	Only one cat, Bella, talked to Jerry. She introduced her friends to him. They played together.
P6	Size doesn't matter. Enemies? Pppffffttt!Who cares about that?! More and more cats began to want to play and chat with Jerry and Bella.
P7	Jerry told them how it was to be a mouse. Now they are all friends with Jerry.
P8	A year later, two new students joined the school! They were Bubba the bird and Luna the fish!
