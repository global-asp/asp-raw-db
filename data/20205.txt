P1	This is Cat. 

This is Dog.
P2	Cat and Dog want to draw. 

Cat and Dog want to colour. 

Cat and Dog want to make art. 

Dog starts.

He takes a pencil and he takes a paper. The paper is a square.
P3	First Dog draws an oval. 

The oval is the body of Cat.

Wow, that is simple!
P4	Then he draws two triangles on top of the oval.

The two triangles are the ears of Cat and he draws a black triangle in the oval. 

The black triangle is the nose of Cat and he draws a line above the nose.
P5	Now he draws the eyes and the eyebrows of Cat.

The eyes are two dots.

The eyebrows are two lines.

Wow, that is easy!
P6	Then he draws the mouth of Cat. 

The mouth is a line.

It looks like the letter ‘w’ and he draws the hairs of Cat. 

Three hairs on the left side and three hairs on the right side.
P7	The drawing is almost finished. 

He draws the arms and legs of Cat. 

The arms and legs are lines and he draws the toe of Cat.

The toes are circles and he draws the tail of Cat. 

The tail is a long line.
P8	At last he draws some stripes on the body of Cat and he colours the body orange. 

Then the drawing is finished.

Wow, that is beautiful!
P9	Now it is Cat's turn. 

He takes a pencil and he takes a paper. 

The paper is a rectangle.
P10	First Cat draws an oval. 

The oval is the body of Dog.

Wow, that is good!
P11	Then he draws two black forms on top of the oval.

The two black forms are the ears of Dog and he draws a black circle in the oval.

The black circle is the nose of Dog and he draws a line above the nose.
P12	Now he draws the eyes and the eyebrows of dog.

The eyes are two dots.

The eyebrows are two lines.

Wow, that is perfect!
P13	Then he draws the mouth of Dog. 

The mouth is a line. 

The shape is again the letter ‘w’ and he draws some dots around the mouth of Dog. 

Three on the left side and three on the right side.
P14	The drawing is almost finished. 

He draws the arms and legs of Dog.

The arms and legs are lines and he draws the toe of Dog.

The toes are circles and he draws the tail of Dog.
The tail looks like a flower.
P15	At last he draws some black circles on the body of Dog and he colours the body yellow.

Then the drawing is finished.

Wow, that is wonderful!
P16	Bye bye Cat.

Bye bye drawing of Cat.

Bye bye Dog.

Bye bye drawing of Dog.
