page_text:

P1	Grandma loved me. 

She told me many secrets except one.
P2	“What is the basket and leaves for?” 

Grandma said, “For magic.”
P3	I wanted to watch. 

But grandma sent me to do something else.
P4	“Where are they?” 

“They are in my magic place,” grandma said.
P5	Grandma sent me to her room. 

I smelled ripening bananas.
P6	I had discovered grandma’s magic place. 

I had seen the ripening bananas.
P7	I ate one. 

It was the sweetest banana I had ever tasted.
P8	I took four bananas. 

I hid them under my dress.
P9	On market day, grandma took foodstuffs to sell. 

I was ashamed.
P10	When I was called later, I knew why. 

I never stole again.
