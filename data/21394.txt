P1	Man, Lion, Dog, Puff Adder, Eagle and Donkey went
to war.
P2	A husband and wife agreed to kill their cow for them.
P3	Each one wanted a part of the cow. They promised rewards.
P4	The husband and wife gave each animal the part they wanted.
P5	They ate and slept well. In the morning, they
went away.
P6	Many weeks later, Lion brought a big elephant tusk for them.
P7	Dog took care of the tusk so thieves would not steal it.
P8	The husband’s brother said, “I will take the tusk from them.”
P9	When he went to steal the tusk, Puff Adder bit him.
P10	The husband and wife took the dead brother’s cows and sheep.
P11	Eagle saw elders carrying money and expensive jewels.
P12	Eagle took the money and jewels to the husband and wife.
P13	Donkey carried a heavy bag of money for his bad
master.
P14	Donkey took the money to the husband and wife.
P15	The man said, “The animals have rewarded us. Man
has not.”
P16	They waited and waited, but Man never went back.
