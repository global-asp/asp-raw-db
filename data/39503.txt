P1	Yashim was a great hunter. @@He killed all kinds of game with his gun and traps in the forest.
P2	He sold the meat to women at good prices. @@He also sold at credit to his customers.
P3	His wife, Adoo, worked on the farm. She planted different types of crops. @@Her children always assisted her at work.
P4	Yashim always used the money he made from selling game meat on drink. @@Neighbours would always call Adoo to go and carry her drunk husband from the market square.
P5	Yashim always collected items from traders on credit. "When my debtors pay me, I will pay you." @@He never paid.
P6	One day, Yashim came across a dry human skull in the forest. "What are you doing here? He asked the skull. @@"My own mouth killed me," the skull replied.
P7	Yashim ran to the palace to report to the King. "Long live the King! I have seen a skull that speaks." @@"You are drunk again!" the King said. @@"If you find that it's not true, kill me," Yashim said.
P8	They reached the forest. The skull did not speak. @@The guards kicked the skull. It only rolled over.
P9	The guards marched Yashim back to the palace. @@He wondered, "Was it the drink that spoke in my head?"
P10	He remembered the skull telling him, "My mouth killed me. Yours will also kill you."
P11	He also remembered hearing many voices speaking as Adoo pushed him home in the wheelbarrow.
P12	He fell at the king's feet and cried, "My mouth has killed me!"
