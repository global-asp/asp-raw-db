page_text:

P1	It was during the holidays.This time my parents had promised me a trip to BANTULODGE.I couldn't wait for that day,because I was so excited to see the beautiful sceneries and wildlife away from home.
P2	Next morning as I woke up,my parents told me to prepare for the trip.I took a bath wore my best dress and shoes.Well,I also took breakfast.I packed my notebook and pen too to put down what I had seen on that day
P3	We set  for the journey.In two hours time we were already at Bantu Lodge.We were welcomed so well.The cool environment had a big hotel and beautiful landscaping.We  headed to the hotel,there we took some refreshments and delicious meals.
P4	I was so excited.I also saw many families who had come to spend their holidays there.We had an instructor who took us round the park.We saw wild animals like elephants,lion,antelope and zebras,I was filled with excitement.
P5	Later on it was time to leave the park.It was fun.We went down to a swimming pool and enjoyed the waters.Luckily,we had carried a few changing clothes.It was evening,and now we had to leave for home.We got inside our car,and went back home.
P6	I had a great experience at Bantulodge.I was very happy.I thanked my parents so much for taking me out for a trip.
