page_text:

P1	Once, there lived a farmer who had two little sons. They were called Momoh and Sorie. The boys were twins.

They loved to eat rice. Every day after school, they went to meet their father at the farm.
P2	Each time, the boys took rice with them.

Along the road to the farm lived Monkey. 

Monkey loved to eat rice too.
P3	Whenever Momoh and Sorie passed by the forest, Monkey threatened them. 

He said, "You small boys, give me what you have in that basket. If you do not give it to me, I'll do something bad to you!"
P4	Momoh and Sorie were afraid. They gave the rice to Monkey and he ate it hungrily. Monkey told the boys not to tell their father.

This happened every day. Momoh and Sorie were afraid to tell their father.
P5	The two boys became thinner by the day. Their father noticed this and asked them why it was so.

"Along the road to the farm, lives Monkey. He takes our rice every day and eats it," cried Momoh.
P6	"He says if we don't give him the rice, he will do something bad to us," Sorie said crying as well.

"Why didn't you tell me?" their father asked sternly.
P7	"Monkey says we should not tell you," the boys replied together.

The father looked his sons in the eyes and said, "Didn't I tell you not to keep secrets from me?"
P8	Momoh and Sorie remembered that quite well and they kept quiet. 

Their father said, "Now, I will teach you how to trick Monkey."
P9	When Momoh and Sorie next went to the farm, they carried a bigger basket with them. 

They reached the spot where Monkey always waited, and he came out to meet them.
P10	Monkey threatened the boys. He said, "You small boys, give me what you have in that basket. If you do not, I will do something bad to you." 

Momoh and Sorie gave Monkey the basket.
P11	When Monkey opened the basket, a big dog jumped out and bit him! 

Monkey cried in pain and ran into the forest.
P12	Since that time, Monkey has not returned. 

The twins grew up and became famous farmers.
