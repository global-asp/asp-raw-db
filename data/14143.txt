page_text:

P1	Long long time ago in the village of kisaku, there lived a noisy hare called Apwuoyo. He was very lazy and ever stole his neighbor's carrots and sweet potatoes. He did this for several days without being caught by the owner.
P2	Ever night, Apwuoyo would creep and walk slowly to his neighbor shamba anad steal the carrots. Unluckily the third time when he went he got a trap resembling an animal. He moved closer to it and tried to touch with his left hand.
P3	Apwuoyo was surprised to find himself stuck on the trap. So he tried with his two legs and were stuck too. After sometime Othimu who was the owner of the shamba came to supervise his shamba, and was amazed to find his neighbor stuck on the trap he had set.
P4	As it was said by the wiseman, "A thieves days are numbered." It reached forty days for Apwouyo and had to pay for his bad character. That's the end of my story.
