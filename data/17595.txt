page_text:

P1	Once there was a young man called Kumbana.
P2	When he was 25,  he fell in love with a girl called Zangane.
P3	They were together for 3 years,  but he didn't have enough money to marry her.
P4	Then one day she found she was pregnant,  because they didn't use protection.
P5	A little girl was born,  and they called her Kheri.
P6	But Kumbana was still studying,  and Zangane had a job in a town far away,  so they had to live apart.
P7	After a while,  Zangane found a new boyfriend. He came to live with her and the little girl.
P8	Kumbana was heart-broken. He cried and cried because he was separated from his daughter.
P9	Time went on,  and Kumbana found a new girlfriend too. They lived together,  but they did not have any children.
P10	Now Kheri did not like her new father at all. She was very unhappy,  and he used to beat her.
P11	So when she was 12,  her mother decided to send her back to live with her real father.
P12	Then Kumbana and Kheri were both happy again.
