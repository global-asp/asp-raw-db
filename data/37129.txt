page_text:

P1	One day while I was sitting in class, I looked through the window and saw a big brown eagle fly past.@@The eagle's wings were wide open but the wings weren't flapping. @@This made me curious. I wanted to know more about flying.
P2	Maybe birds influenced the invention of airplanes. They both have wings.@@I wish I could fly, but I do not have wings.@     @I went to the library to find books about airplanes. I wanted to know how they fly.
P3	I saw pictures of different flying machines. Some machines had engines, some did not.@@I saw a hang glider and a parachute. @@I saw a rocket, a helicopter, a zeppelin, hot air balloons, and some very old airplanes. Ones you could find in museums.
P4	How does an airplane fly? Most modern airplanes are powered by jet engines.  @@Jet engines move an airplane forward very fast. That makes the air flow very fast over the airplane's wings.@@The wings push the air back towards the ground. That causes an upward pressure or force. The upward force holds an airplane in the sky.
P5	The closest thing I can do to flying, is in an airplane. Have you ever been in an airplane? @@I have always dreamed of flying in a big airliner.@@My teacher told us that we can make our wishes come true just by closing our eyes and imagining.
P6	I am your pilot. I am the captain of this aeroplane.  @@Please fasten your seatbelt and prepare to take off from the ground.@@Clear the runway, I am starting the jet engines!
P7	You are a passenger sitting at the window seat. @@We are speeding along the runway. We are taking off from the airport.@@The airplane's engines and wings push us into the air. We will fly higher than any bird.
P8	My teacher said we can do anything in our imagination.  @@She said we can be whatever we want to be, or do anything we want in our minds @@Where would you like to fly to?
