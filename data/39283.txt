P1	Yolanda had a thought this afternoon. "I should eat healthier."@@"That's a great thought, Yolanda. What food do you have in mind?"@@"Fruit," she said.
P2	"Okay. Once we're finished coloring, we'll go to the store and buy some more fruit."@@"Yay. Thank you, mom."@@"Do you want to color a rainbow like me?"
P3	"Yes ma'am."@@"Here are the colors I used. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple."
P4	"Thank you."@@"How do you know which healthy foods to eat?"@@"I study nutrition. It's good to have a well balanced diet of every food group."
P5	"What are the foods in every food group?"@@"Well, we have vegetables, grains like pasta and bread, fruit as you mentioned, meat like chicken, fats which you can find in oils and nuts, and of course dessert."@@"Those are all delicious."
P6	"They are. Which fruit do you want from the grocery store?@@"Oranges."@@"Okay, we will buy oranges."
