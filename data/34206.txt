P1	Afeefah is a baby white rhinoceros.@@Rangers rescued her from the bush.
P2	Her mum was killed by poachers.@@The rangers took Afeefah to a place of safety.
P3	Afeefah's heart was broken.@@And, she was afraid that the poachers would return to take her horn.
P4	Slowly, Afeefah made friends.@@She felt safe and played in the mud.@@She drank nutritious milk at the sanctuary.
P5	One day Afeefah asked her friend Aaminah, "Why do they want our horns?"@@Aaminah snorted, "They believe that our horns are magical!"
P6	"But our horns are not magical!" cried Afeefah.@@"No, of course not. Horns are the same as hair and nails," said Aaminah.
P7	Afeefah and Aaminah are the last of their kind.@@The white rhinoceros is nearly extinct.@@They are almost all gone from our world.
P8	We can save the rhino and other animals that are almost extinct.@@What can you do?@@Find out more!
