page_text:

P1	A long time ago,  there was a man who lived with his wife whom he loved very much. One day he took a walk to the forest. Along the way,  he met a tall,  slender,  and very beautiful girl. He fell in love with her at first sight. The girl too readily accepted him. But she told him that she had only one breast.
P2	So she told him to go home,  cut off one of his wife's breasts and bring it to her. Then she would have two breasts,  and they could marry. The man ran very fast back home,  picked a knife,  pounced on his dear wife,  and the breast was off instantly.
P3	He hurried back to the forest to where he had left his newfound darling. But she was nowhere to be seen. He called her name very loudly,  but there was complete silence. Then he heard a voice saying,  "Why are you calling? Don't you know that you are in the forest area of Musambwa kwa Libeeletwela?"
P4	When the man heard that,  he ran home as fast as a bullet only to find his wife had just died. He was so grief stricken because of what he had done that he too died.
