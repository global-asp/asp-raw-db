page_text:

P1	Kate has a thing in her head. 

How will they remove it?
P2	It makes her tired. 

It pains her. 

It makes her feel heavy.
P3	She can't eat. She can't drink. 

She is not as jolly as before.
P4	Oh dear. Poor woman! Her head throbs with pain.

A doctor scans her head.
P5	The doctor sees a swelling in her head and says, "There is a tumour in your brain."
P6	"We have to remove it from your brain right now. We have to remove it now!" the doctor says.
P7	They bring a stretcher.
P8	They arrange the surgical blades.
P9	They inject her with syringes.
P10	They cut open Kate's head.
P11	They remove the brain.
P12	They cut out the tumour.
P13	They return the brain to the skull. 

Then they stitch the head back together again.
P14	Does Kate feel everything they do? 

No! Kate is in heaven. She does not feel. She does not eat. She does not think. For 24 hours!
P15	Then she comes back to life!
P16	Now she is well. Like a new born baby.
P17	We are all happy for our friend Kate, who tasted heaven.
