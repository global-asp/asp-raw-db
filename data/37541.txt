P1	Long long ago there was a very hungry Dinosaur. His name was Dino. @@One day Dino woke up very very hungry and had to search for food.
P2	On the other side of the Desert it was baby Rhino's birthday party. @@"Ahh! Cried baby Rhino. Who ate all my cake?"
P3	"Over here! Here is a footprint!" yells Hippo. @@There is a large footprint in the sand just behind baby Rhino's birthday cake @"This looks like Dino's footprint" says Crocodile.@"Look there is a trail of cake crumbs" says Lizards.
P4	As the animals followed the cake crumbs they heard snoring that got louder and louder.@Everyone saw Dino laying asleep in the sand. @The animals surrounded Dino untill he woke.
P5	When Dino woke up Daddy Rhino spoke to him. "Why did you eat baby Rhino's cake?" Daddy Rhino asked Dino. "I was hungry" cried Dino.@"Did you know that it's very wrong to take other animals things without their permission?" asked Daddy Rhino
P6	"I did not know that" replied Dino. Dino immediately apologized to baby Rhino.@@All the animals went back to baby Rhino's house to enjoy a cake that Dino made .
