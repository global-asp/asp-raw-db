page_text:

P1	There one time was a girl, she was 8  1/2 years old. Her name was Annabella Marie Ericson, but most people call her Bella. Bella went to a school, and what a year she had. Bella just moved to EL Elementary school.
P2	But there was this one girl. Mandy was her name. Mandy was so popular. She was really mean though. She made everything go her way because her dad was the principal of the EL Elementary school. It was Bella's first year at EL.
P3	And Mandy made it worse. One time Bella was playing with her friends at recess and Mandy kicked the soccer ball in Bella's face. She had to go to the nurses office after she told on Mandy, but not even the teacher believed it at all.
P4	Then the next day she was selling oranges and telling her friend all about food. Mandy came and "accidentally" spilled all the oranges, then said it was an accident, and it was not. There is more that she did.
P5	It was amost the last day of school, and Bella changed Mandy. She talked to Mandy saying something like "I know you don't like me but why? Why don't you like me, Why? Think about it." And then Bella left and Mandy thought about it.
P6	On the last day of school, and Mandy replied. Mandy said "See, when I was 7 I looked just like you, and everyone went against me. I hated everyone, so when my dad became principal I started being mean because I wouldn't get into trouble."
P7	Bella didn't know how to respond to that, but she did, and she said "oh, can you be my friend please, if you want to." Gess what Mandy did! She said yes, and now no one can stop them!
