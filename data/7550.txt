page_text:

P1	Atabo and Akiru went to the river to collect water.
P2	On their way back home they rested on some rocks.
P3	Atabo tried to stand up to continue home. But she was stuck to the rock. Akiru ran home to call mother.
P4	When mother arrived at the rock,  she found Atabo truly stuck.
P5	"I will make a fence around the rock to protect you from wild animals," mother said to Atabo.
P6	So,  she made a fence. And she made one door for her to get inside.
P7	Hyena was hiding and listening. He watched when mother came to feed Atabo.
P8	Hyena tried to copy mother's song. He practised and practised.
P9	The other animals told Hyena to swallow a fly from the river so that he could sing better. He swallowed a fly from the river and went to sing. But the door did not open.
P10	Next,  he swallowed a fly from the nearby plains and he went to sing. But the door did not open. Finally he swallowed a fly from the far away plains.
P11	With this new voice he again went to sing at the door. The door opened,  and Hyena ate Atabo.
P12	When mother came again,  she sang,  and sang,  and sang. But nothing happened. So she called a meeting of all the animals and lit a large fire. "The animal that ate Atabo will fall into the fire and burn," she said.
P13	All the animals jumped safely over the fire. Only Fox and Hyena remained.
P14	Fox jumped and the fire caught his tail. He cried in pain. Last of all came the hyena. He jumped and fell into the fire.
P15	Then all the animals sang,  "Ata kalio. Anikanyamit ikon koku. Achakakin nakim na,  chi. Gi. Gir."
