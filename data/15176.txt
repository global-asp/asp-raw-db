desc:	A mother and her daughter on the day of admission to a new boarding school

page_text:

P1	My mother and I woke up very early in the morning. We prepared for the journey to Nakuru, for a new admission in class four.I had done  my class three exam that i performed so well and so my parents decided to take me to a boarding school.
P2	After we were done preparing,  we started our journey at 7: 00am.I looked smart and beautiful.
P3	After walking for some metres we got to the bus station but there were no vehicles. It was now 9: 00am and no vehicle had shown up. People become so impatient but after a long wait the bus eventually arrived.
P4	After four hours of waiting, a bus arrived and we boarded  but before the bus could depart a woman came running and requested one of the passengers to alight  so that she would get a seat since she was was going for work yet she was very late. No one was willing to stand so that she could get a seat and so i requested  my mother if we could vacate the seat for her. My mother agreed and we alighted the bus to wait for another bus. After 10 minutes,  another bus arrived and we boarded.
P5	The bus was moving very fast and after an hour we arrived to the school that i was going to be admitted. As we got into the school compound, we found a very big queue of parents and their children waiting to be served.
P6	Immediately we got to the administration block, we saw that lady who we had vacated the seat for. She was surprised to see us too. She called us and I was admitted without making the queue. We later realized that she was the headteacher of that school. It was because of our humbleness that we were favored.
