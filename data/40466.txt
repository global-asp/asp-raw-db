page_text:

P1	Long ago, Raven had white feathers. @@Hyena and Raven were good friends. They always searched for food together.@@One day, Raven told Hyena that he had seen a beehive.
P2	They agreed to go and take the honey. @@Raven flew up into the tree and dropped honey down for Hyena to collect.@@But when Raven came down, there was no honey!
P3	Hyena ate all the honey and his stomach was full. @@He asked Raven to sew his bottom closed. @@Hyena did not want any sweetness from the honey to leave his body.
P4	Days passed, and Hyena could not go to the toilet. @@He was very uncomfortable. He could not eat or sleep.@@"I need Raven to cut open my bottom," thought Hyena.
P5	On his way, Hyena met Goat. He asked her whether she had seen Raven.@@"No, I haven't seen Raven. Keep searching," said Goat
P6	Next, Hyena met Hare and asked her whether she had seen Raven. @@"You will find Raven further along the road," said Hare.
P7	Finally, Hyena found Raven. @@"After you sewed my bottom, I could not relieve myself. I need to go to the toilet, please cut the stiches!" Hyena pleaded.
P8	Raven cut the stiches with his beak. He could not get out of the way in time as Hyena relieved himself! @@Raven was no longer white. Hyena and Raven were no longer friends.
