page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, an old woman lived in a far place . She came from a poor background with no family nor friends. Well wishers provided her with food and other basic needs. One day, she sat in her house and thought about her life.
P2	Suddenly a fairy appeared out of nowhere.  The old woman was shocked beyond words. She shook like a chameleon on a feeble twig. She was almost to scream when the fairy told her to calm down.
P3	"I come in peace and I want to grant your wish. I have been watching over you for a very long time. You have been lonely." She @added. The old woman explained to her about her life.
P4	The fairy decided to transform her life although she could not grant her a family. The fairy touched her and She suddenly started spinning very fast. The fairy was granting her wish.
P5	She found herself in a new beautiful and bigger house. She looked around amazingly.
P6	After a week, the fairy came to visit her.  She met her wearing a sad face.
P7	She complained about the house. She was dissatisfied with its size. She wanted a bigger one than this.
P8	The fairy worked her magic again. She touched her once more and she spinned several times.
P9	She found herself standing on the floor of another magnificent house. Actually, this was no ordinary house, it was a mansion.
P10	Once again the fairy visited her while she sat on the sofa. "How is the new house?" she asked. The old woman thanked her but she said it was too big and lonely.
P11	She asked the fairy for another wish to get back to her former house. The fairy agreed to grant her her wish. She touched her and she swirled around rapidly.
P12	She found herself in her old hut. She told the fairy that visiting her everyday was a waste of time. She begged her for one last wish, to have something that could grant her wishes anytime she wanted anything.
P13	The fairy made the old woman's carpet magical and anytime she stood on it her wishes could be granted. The old woman thanked her and promised to pray for her everyday. The fairy vanished and the old woman lived happily ever after.
