page_text:

P1	When I woke up this morning it was crisp and clear outside with a sharp shard-like cold biting through passersby bones. It's going to be a long weekend for me. The perfect time for refreshment and renewal. Welcome to the weekend method.
P2	So when I said refreshment ,I didn't mean sipping some mint cooler on a deck chair. What I meant was renew your surroundings and yourself. Declutter the disastrous. Destroy the drama. Just let go of the junk. And give your bedroom a glow up
P3	So without further ado here's your steps: Empty all your belongings (Clear your desk as well)on your bed and organise it into categories very neatly. Fold clothing and throw away junk. @Step two: Put everything in it's new and neat order.
P4	Make sure that the new best order is maintainable.@Step three: talk to your room and say things like: I love my savings box/bank.etc, because it reminds me to invest in my self love and discipline. And no, I'm not crazy. You have to do it.
P5	Step four: Do these steps in your mind. Open all the tabs for your files, organise them throw away unnecessary files to make space for new ones, Recycle bin: Loss turns to lessons. Anger turns to Why am I sad?, Declutter your mind space.
P6	You are in your own head, day in, day out just like you are in your bedroom most of the time. If your surroundings don't satisfy you then you have to change it.
P7	When I wrote this book I thought: People do not know their minds. They are only doing physical activity all day long. So I will show them physically in order to unlock the mentally. Draw the inside of your bedroom and your brain. Similar?
