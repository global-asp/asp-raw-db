page_text:

P1	In the land of Quarolopinat, lived a very beautiful princess called Arach.
P2	All the noble men of the land showed great interest in Arach.
P3	They  competed with each other to win her heart. But all was in vain.
P4	Arach's father, Ojok, occasionally asked Arach why she showed no interest.
P5	But she proudly replied, "Papa, none of those men are worth my beauty."
P6	"My beauty and status in this land matches that of the white man."
P7	Over and over again, Arach kept arrogantly rejecting the men of the land.
P8	So the men moved on and married the other ladies of the land.
P9	Years passed, and still Arach's plan to marry a white man were a dream.
P10	Her friends were all married with happy families. Yet here was Arach.
P11	Every year she grew older, but still her pride didn't let her marry.
P12	"I'm getting too old to have children, but I still won't marry these men."
P13	Arach turned 40 years and still did not have a white husband.
P14	She became a laughing stock for all the girls of the village.
P15	They referred to her as the wasted beauty of the village.
P16	No one wanted to identify themselves with Arach. She was seen as a disgrace
P17	Her father, the chief of the land, was the only one that still loved her.
P18	Sadly, he too later passed on and Arach was left all alone in life.
P19	She cried every day as people laughed at her everywhere she went.
P20	Luckily, an old man in the neighboring village of Awere married her.
P21	She accepted only because she had lost everything with her father's death.
P22	She realized that if she didn't get married, she wouldn't survive in life.
P23	Arach was brutally mistreated by the old man until she eventually died.
