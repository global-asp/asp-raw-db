desc:	A little girl saw her father get killed.

page_text:

P1	On a cold winter night, a young girl by the name of Liz was with her father James. They lived in an old small cabin deep in the forest of Alaska filled with pine trees and wolves. Winter had just given its worst on that night.
P2	Everywhere filled with snow, and the darkness of night.
P3	On that very night James told his daughter “Honey, we need to stay close tonight, sleep by the fire.”
P4	“It’s going to be really cold tonight right daddy.” Replied Liz with an innocent tone, having no idea on what would take place on that cold winter night.
P5	“Tock tock tock” It was midnight and someone had just knocked on the cabin door. James and Liz woke up and looked at each other with a face of uncertainty. “Who is it daddy?” whispered Liz.
P6	“I don’t know honey, just ….don’t make sound.” replied James as if their lives were in grave danger. “We know you’re in there James. Give us the codes James!?” said the voice of the man that stood outside the cabin.
P7	James stood up and was freaking out. He then crouched  in fear and told Liz. “Honey it’s going to be okay, stay in here.” Shaking, he stood up and walked outside the cabin to face the man.
P8	Liz, curious of what was taking place, peaked through the window. Two shady men in black hoods were intimidating James. They violently pushed him to the wall of the cabin.
P9	One man in black said, “James, my boss needs those codes.” “I’m sorry won’t ever do that .”    Replied James crying.
P10	“ Do you even know what those codes can do?”said the hooded man, “those codes give us access to the most dangerous virus humanity will ever face, it is the cleansing of humanity."
P11	The solution to overpopulation,… and know u know too much.” The hooded men took two steps back and pointed a Glock 19 gun to his dead. “Poww!” echoed the sound of the trigger going off.
P12	They had just made a clean shot to the head, and now James is lying dead in the snow.
P13	A chubby man with a snow plowing truck was passing that area and heard the gunshot. The men in black hoods ran to the deep dark forest.
P14	The Chubby man came out of his truck and picked up James, and at that moment he saw Liz peeking by the window, crying. “ It’s going to be fine child, come with me.”
P15	She came out of the cabin and not knowing what happened, went with the man.
P16	Three months later, she was in Washington DC, in a hotel guarded by police officers. It turns out her father was a Genius computer coder. Who could have gained access to a deadly virus capable of killing millions of people around the Globe.
P17	She is now the witness of her father’s murder, and the daughter of the man who saved humanity.
