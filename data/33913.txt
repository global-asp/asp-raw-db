P1	Chiagoziem and his mom Chinyere went to Eri Kingdom in Aguleri, Anambra State, Nigeria.  It is the land of his ancestors.  He was very excited to see the King again.
P2	The Royal Leopard made the great announcement so everyone would know. DNA testing works!  Chinyere found her ancestral home because she took the test.
P3	‘’Ahem, Let it be known that a daughter and son of the soil have returned!!’’, the Royal Leopard proclaimed.  The entire kingdom was silent for a moment .
P4	Then they all let out a great rejoicing ululate.  Chiagoziem held his mother’s hand as he watched them dance.
P5	Chiagoziem and his mom were taken to the palace to see the king.  The Royal Leopard advised them to never mention that they heard the animals speak.
P6	The Lion became very still.  Chiagoziem and his mom watched in awe.  The Lion said ‘’shhh’’.  They both were as quiet as a mouse.
P7	The King arrived with his cabinet to greet them both.  He welcomed them to his Kingdom.  He looked at them while smiling.  He asked “have they talked to you yet?’’
P8	Chiagoziem almost answered but they heard a drum beating. Children arrived. They all stepped outside.
P9	They saw the animals around but they could not hear them.  It seemed as if they were holding a meeting. The king smiled and told them to get some rest.
P10	There is a journey ahead.  He retired to his chambers. The dancing continued.  The Royal Lion roared.  Everyone turned to him, except the elephant.
P11	She was hard of hearing.  So the zebras advised her to turn around.  The Royal Lion said, “we must get our rest, for tomorrow we will go the where the two rivers meet.
P12	Stay tuned to find out what happened the next day when the entire kingdom went to the two rivers.
