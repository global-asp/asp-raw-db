page_text:

P1	One day a farmer went to the market.
P2	He forgot to give fodder to the donkey. It felt very hungry.
P3	The donkey thought something. It had to open the door and go out. It opened the door, went out and ate. After it ate, it headed to another place. On its way, a thorn pierced its hoof.
P4	In another village, it saw beautiful grass. It thought that its own village was bad. It had no grass to eat. It was attracted by the scene.
P5	The donkey kept walking and saw a hyena coming, carrying a sheep's skin. The donkey was shocked.
P6	As it approached, it threw away the sheep's clothing and told the donkey how it cheated the donkey. The donkey felt pain in its legs.
P7	"I will eat you now," screemed the hyena. The donkey responded, "A thorn just pierced my hoof. Therefore, if you eat me, it may get stuck in your throat."
P8	"Okay. Let me remove the thorn and eat you," proposed the hyena. The hyena removed the thorn from the donkey's hoof. Immediately, the donkey kicked the hyena. The hyena fell down.
P9	As the hyena fell down, the donkey headed home. The farmer came back from the market. He sought the donkey for a long time. He found her after he sought for a long time and felt tired. The farmer felt happy.
