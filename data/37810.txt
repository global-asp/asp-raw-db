desc:	On a summer night

page_text:

P1	It was a dark summer night and the boy scouts were camping near the lake. They had built a big fire which they sat huddled to warm up.
P2	The night was lovely but cool as the breeze lazily blew around camp.
P3	The troop leader is standing and telling scary stories and humorous jokes. The children were listening little, waiting patiently for the end of the story before retiring to their tent and eventually falling asleep. It had been a long day.
