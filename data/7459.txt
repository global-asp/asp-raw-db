P1	Long time ago,  there were four little boys.
P2	They were studying at Pedo primary school.
P3	The boys used to go to school with out taking breakfast.
P4	They used to dose in class because of hunger.
P5	One day,  they decided to escape from school to a nearby place and look for something to eat.
P6	After crossing to a nearby place,  they saw a bigger mango tree which was full of ripe mangoes.
P7	The boys looked at each other and smiled. Aaaaaa. We have been very hungry but,  said one little boy.
P8	All ran to a mango tree. Picked up some mangoes from the mango tree,  smiled and started eating. Do you now what they forgot to do?
P9	While eating,  the owner of the mangoes came walking in bigger strides. ''Who has given you my mangoes?'' asked the man.
P10	As soon as they heard that voice,  the boys ran as fast as they could and hid somewhere. They said to each other that no shouting,  no coughing and no talking.
P11	The owner of the mangoes made an alarm,  ''wa a a la la la,  wa a a la la la,  here are the thieves.
P12	The boys were caught,  taken to school,  called their parents,  the teachers,  and the school children to gather.
P13	The boys were given a punishment. Each got some ten strokes and repented not to steal anything again.
