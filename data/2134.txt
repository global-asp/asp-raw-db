page_text:

P1	Mother was finishing packing her clothes in a small bag.
P2	As she went out the door,  she hugged me and said,  "Bye for now."
P3	"Where are you going,  mum?" I looked up at her as I asked.
P4	I started to cry wanting to follow her but dad lifted me up on his shoulder.
P5	Dad said,  "Your mother is going to the hospital to have a baby."
P6	When I heard "baby" I stopped crying and looked at him. "Why is she going to get the baby from the hospital?" I asked him.
P7	Dad sat me on a small chair and said,  "I will tell you why she is going to get the baby from the hospital."
P8	My dad held me close and said,  "We will always love you."
P9	"Can I write a letter to her while she is there?" I asked dad.
P10	That evening,  I began to write a letter to mum.
P11	I tore a paper from my exercise book and began to write.
P12	"Mummy,  mummy,  dad said that you have gone to bring another baby."
P13	Please hurry up and return home.
P14	I want you to bring a baby girl,  so I can play with her when she grows up.
P15	You can bring two so one can be mine.
P16	I am waiting for you here outside our house.
P17	I folded my letter so I could give it to my father to bring it to mum. When I woke up the following morning,  the letter was gone.
