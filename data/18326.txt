desc:	Musau’s father got drunk every night

page_text:

P1	Musau lived with his father,  Syonzola.
P2	Syonzola went to drink alcohol every day.
P3	Syonzola came home drunk. He called,  "Help! A hyena is killing me."
P4	The people came. There was no hyena.
P5	Syonzola did this every night.
P6	Every time Syonzola shouted,  Musau woke up.
P7	One night,  a hyena waited for Syonzola.
P8	Syonzola cried,  "Help!"  The people said,  "We are tired. Syonzola is tricking us again."
P9	Musau waited. His father did not arrive.
P10	"My father is really in danger," Musau said.
P11	Musau ran outside.
P12	"Father! Father!" He called. The hyena ran away.
P13	From that day,  Syonzola changed. Now he tells children stories.
