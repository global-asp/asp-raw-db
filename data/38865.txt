page_text:

P1	Sipho is an inquisitive young boy who enjoys riddles and the underwater natural life.  He finds delight in swimming amongst great white sharks, tropical fish and witnessing the diverse colourful sea life. Until one day...
P2	His dad came to him with an exciting surprise. "What is it Dad? Tell me, tell me!" excitedly yelled Sipho. Dad explained, "Today I'm taking you on a mysterious adventure in the Indian Ocean." "What is the Indian Ocean Dad?" muddled Sipho. "The Indian Ocean is the youngest of the major oceans."
P3	"What kind of fish is funny dad?" asked Sipho. "I'm not too sure," said Dad confusingly. "A clown fish!" said Sipho.
P4	Dad and Sipho eagerly dived into the water where they approached an animal with 8 long limbs protruding from a globe shaped head. Which creature could it be?
P5	Their journey continued through the squishy slimy seaweed. Dad explained to Sipho that red and brown seaweed grow mostly in salt water, whereas green seaweed grows in fresh water.
P6	They discovered a creature that does not have gills, scales or fins. They move quite differently compared to the rest of the sea life creatures. They have a variety of colours, shapes and sizes which resemble a star! What do you think it is?
P7	"These are sea sponges that live in the ocean", explained Sipho's dad. "A sea sponge is one of the world's smallest living organisms and grows in all different shapes, textures and sizes. It is made up of hard shell which protects them from other marine life creatures."
P8	The last thing that they came across was a big, scary, grey creature! Its teeth are as sharp as a needle. @Can you guess what it is? @All sharks have great senses which makes them excellent hunters. Their sense of smell is so good that they can detect blood in the water from kilometers away!
P9	"What an adventure! My favourite part was learning about the diverse animal and plant life under the sea." said Sipho. What was your favourite part?
