page_text:

P1	There was famine in the animal kingdom, but there was plenty food in heaven above. Tortoise and the other animals were invited to a feast.
P2	Tortoise begged for feathers from the other animals. He told the animals that they all needed new names for the feast
P3	Tortoise then said, his name was all of you
P4	When they arrived at the feast, they were given a lot of food
P5	Tortoise ate all the food alone, which made the other animals very angry
P6	They collected their feathers from Tortoise and Tortoise didn't know how to return back from the foreign land
P7	Tortoise told the animals to tell his wife to bring out all the soft materials in his house to enable him jump down from up
P8	Tortoise saw his wife putting down things, he didn't know that the animals had told his wife to bring out hard things in the house
P9	He jumped from up and scattered into pieces. That is the reason behind tortoise having uneven shells
