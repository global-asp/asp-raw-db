page_text:

P1	Lynne, Oupa Karel and Anton were getting things ready for Lynne's birthday party.
P2	Anton and Lynne are going to bake a cake. Oupa Karel reads the recipe.
P3	"Let's mix these ingredients in the big bowl," said Lynne.
P4	Anton stirred the ingredients and made a big mess.
P5	"The cake feels heavy now," said Oupa Karel.
P6	"Your friends have arrived," said Oupa Karel.
P7	Anton thought the first present would be heavy because it was big.
P8	It was a pillow and it weighed very little.
P9	Anton thought the next present would be light because it was small.
P10	It was a painted rock and it weighed a lot.
P11	The children said that 1 kilogram of rocks weighs the same as 1 kilogram of feathers.
P12	Lynne's cake was burnt.
P13	Lynne was very sad.
P14	Auntie Mavis asked Anton to guess how much her present weighed.
P15	"It weighs the same as the cake that burned," said Anton.
P16	Everyone said, "happy birthday, Lynne."
