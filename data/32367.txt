P1	Mr. Cherry starts out his life as a little seed. This seed must be planted at the beginning of Autumn so that the cold weather will soften the seed's hard outer shell. Which will make it easier for the seed to grow in Spring.
P2	Make sure when you plant cherry seeds you plant them 15cm apart and about 1cm beneath the soil's surface. Remember to plant seeds where there's LOTS of sunlight. Also, remember to water the seeds if there has been no rain and the soil seems dry.
P3	While we are waiting for the planted seeds to grow let's look at the structure of a Mr. Cherry seed.
P4	Mr. Cherry seeds are dicots so they have two Cotyledons. Cotyledons are the plant's first true leaves. The Endosperm provides nutrients for the young plant while it remains within the seed coat. The seed coat protects the plant until it is mature enough to survive without it.
P5	Let's watch as Mr. Cherry begins to grow. Look at that Radical! A Radical is the first part of the plant to grow. The first part of the plant to reach the surface is called the Hypocotyl. The Hypocotyl will become the stem of the cherry tree.
P6	On this page you see the Cotyledons again. They have become the plant's first true leaves. You also see the Epicotyl which protects the Cotyledons until the plant no longer needs them.
P7	Now let's look at the pretty flowers that will eventually grow!
P8	Each part of the flower has a special name but let's look at the parts that turn the flower into a Mr. Cherry fruit. The Anther makes pollen. When pollen travels from 1 cherry flower to another cherry flower's Stigma and travels down it's Style, to the Ovary it fertilizes the Ovule.
P9	But how does the pollen travel from 1 flower to another to turn the flower into a Mr. Cherry fruit?@That's where Mr. Bee comes in. Mr. Bee likes to collect nectar from many flowers and during his travels he collects pollen.
P10	The pollen on Mr. Bee's feet lands on the Stigma, travels down the Style and to the Ovary. The pollen will finally enter the Ovule and fertilize it.
P11	The Ovule will become a seed called a pit and the Ovary will become a yummy looking Mr. Cherry!
P12	And so ends the exciting life of Mr. Cherry.
P13	Rest In Peace Mr. Cherry.
