P1	Long long ago there was a rooster living with his family.There was a hen with brown and white colour.The two chicks were yellow.
P2	It was early in the morning  the hen called rooster .She asked the rooster to go and asked for a needle from eagle to knit Christmas clothes.The rooster ran quickly to do as told.
P3	Within the wink of an eye the rooster was back."The eagle said I must return the needle before sun set",said the rooster. "Yes darling I will do that"said the hen.
P4	The hen knitted and knitted the whole day without noticing the time. Ultimately she looked at the time.Oooh no is already 10pm ,the eagle is waiting for his needle," she screamed.
P5	"My dear why are screaming"said the rooster."It is already 10pm   I did not look at the time".Rooster kindly return it quickly ".
P6	The rooster ran and ran .On his way he lost the needle.He looked and looked for it with no luck until he's tired.On his own he decided to go back home for assistance.
P7	"Hen,chiks come and help me ,I have lost the needle"said the rooster.The family went out to search for a lost needle. They searched and searched for hours with no luck.At about 6am the chick found it.She shouted with joy and said "I got it"
P8	The rooster returned the needle and apologized to the eagle.On her way back they were happy,hugging and dancing.They celebrated their Christmas day wearing new beautiful clothes.
