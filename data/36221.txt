P1	"Children, behave yourselves while you wait for me," says Ma. "Remember, you are at my clinic. There are patients here." @@"Ma, he started it!"@@"Ma, it's not my fault!"@@"Enough!" says Ma sternly as she leaves her office.
P2	The peace does not last. Yasmin and Yusuf start to bicker and push each other.@@Then Yasmin shoves her brother, and he loses his balance.@@Yusuf falls over backwards and bumps into something hard! CRASH!
P3	Yasmin and Yusuf stare at the pile of bones lying on the ground.@@"You've made a mess of Ma's skeleton!" cries Yasmin.@@"It's your fault, you pushed me!" yells Yusuf.@@"Stop it! We better do something! Otherwise, Ma will be furious," says Yasmin.
P4	Yusuf picks up a bone. "This must be the head bone. It has two holes for eyes, one for the nose, and teeth below."@@"That's definitely the head. This is like a puzzle. We need to figure out where the bones fit," replies Yasmin.
P5	"Where do you think this goes?" asks Yasmin, holding up the rib cage. @@ "I think that is for the chest. And the space below is for the tummy," says Yusuf.@@Yasmin nods, "These must be the hips." They put the bones onto the stand.
P6	"These small bones look like finger-bones," says Yasmin, wiggling the skeleton's hand. @@"I think this is a hand and arm. Can you find the other one?" she asks her brother.@@"How do you know that it isn't a leg bone?" responds Yusuf.
P7	Yasmin puts her hand flat on the floor next to her foot.@@The hand is shorter than the foot. The bones in the hand are shorter than the bones in the foot.@@Yusuf quickly finds the other arm bone.
P8	Yasmin stands on tiptoe to fix the arm bones. Yusuf attaches the leg bones to the skeleton.@@They hear Ma's voice outside. She's almost done!@@Only the skull remains to be put in its place.@@"Quick, Yusuf, pull that chair here," whispers Yasmin.
P9	She climbs on to the chair and places the skull at the top of the skeleton. Yusuf drags the chair back. @@We've done it!" Yasmin hugs Yusuf. Just then, Ma opens her the door to her office.
P10	"It is nice to see the two of you hugging," says Ma as she walks into the room.@@"I have finished my work for the day. Would you like to get some ice-cream?" she asks.
P11	"By the way, you were both very clever to put the skeleton back together correctly," says Ma.@@Yasmin and Yusuf look at each other in surprise.@@How did Ma know?
