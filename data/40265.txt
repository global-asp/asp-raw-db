page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there were 2 wolfs and 1 kid and the kid was getting bored of just eating food "Mom I want to go explore the world" Guess what? His mom did not let him go travel! "No WE are WOLVES we don't go explore the world"!?!
P2	That night the wolf tryed to escape but he was thinking "where should I go first maybe London,Canada,Quebec hmmm how about England! Let's go there,let's go there"! So that is exactly where he went!
P3	"Oh my god England looks so beautiful"! "Wait I think I see another wolf with a rope thing"? " WOOF" WOOF" " what did he say? did my parents not teach me this weird sound"? right after that he heard someone cry "WOLF" "WOLF"
P4	Everybody was panicking but little wolf didn't no why. "Why are you guys running"? He just couldn't figure out why.
P5	Then a dog came up to him and said "come with me". " Why are people running though"? He said "they are scared of you,since your a wolf and other wolfs would bite humans super hard". and then a group of people came with nets. The dog said
P6	"HIDE" he said "why"? " Because they are people that are going to trap us in a jail"! He said "what's a jail"? The dog said "stop asking questions"! The wolf said "ok" then he saw a group of people with nets about to capture him "AHHHHH"
P7	"Stop yelling"! he looked up and saw his mom and got out from bed and huged her very tight. He said " Mommy I will never go to places alone and leave home"! His mom said "Wow when did you learn that from"? He said " Never mind"! *The end*!
