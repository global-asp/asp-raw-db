P1	Yaaliyo omusaja n'omuhasi wuwe nawende ko n'obundi owali nabunobe. There was a man with a wife he loved and another one he didn't love.
P2	 Nawende geyagalanga bugali weene atenga nabunobe abonabona atye  The loved wife was happy while the other wife lived in misery.
P3	 Lulala wamwawe gatega enyuni nga apapasa Ekanga musanvu enyene emba. Once their husband trapped seven guinea fowls.
P4	 Gaƞa nawende Ekanga mukaaga muhuyeda nga aƞa nabunobe Ekanga ndala yokayoka. He allocated the loved one six fowls and gave the other only one.
P5	 Ekanga endala eyigaƞaye nabunobe gayimuƞaye mungiso. The one fowl he gave to the unloved was done secretly.
P6	 Coka nabunobe ni gawene wamwawe natiinire ohweraahaho eyo mu bahye,  gahosesa ekabi eyo yeesi ohuhola nawende ebisirisiinye. However when their husband went for a walk the unloved used the chance to punish the loved.
P7	 Nabunobe gapwanguha mu nyumba n'aƞambire Ekanga mu ngalo nga nawende ati,  ''Ojanga ni wepahapaha oti wamwo ahwenda niwe weka,  ale bona, sigapaye Ekanga enyene enyingi? The unloved rushed out holding the one fowl in her hands and said ''you have been boasting that your husband loves you, hasn't he given me many fowls, more than yours?
P8	Nabunobe gengira munyumba nga nindi atula n'Ekanga enyene yira nga aloma nawende ati, '' Owene Ekanga yino?'' The unloved rushed entered her house and again came out with the same fowl yelling ''have you seem this other one''.
P9	 Nabunobe gengira nindi natula n'Ekanga enyene eyo efunda musanvu, hiisi olugatulanga nga adula Nawende era nga amujeherera. She entered her house and came out seven times with the very fowl and challenged, despised and irritated her co-wife.
P10	Obusungu niwaƞamba Nawende, gengirira munyumba gatusa Ekanga omukaaga gajiholoƞera Nabunobe naloma ati, '' Ale ƞira ninejo josi oje onyanye. '  The loved one lost temper, entered her house and brought out the six fowls she had been given, she hauled them to the unloved saying ''there your, take them and eat''.
P11	  Nabunobe geyangaliye Ekanga ejo omukaaga geyingihisa munyumba nga gejibbula Ekanga musanvu, Nawende nali hu hyeleere. The unloved picked the hallowed fowls into her house for eating.
