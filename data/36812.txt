P1	Hi! My name's Lexi and this is my pet frog, Hoppit. He is very naughty but loves hugs.@@On a normal morning I would go and feed Hoppit his favourite breakfastâ€¦ fat, juicy, hairy, flies. But, this was a special morning because as I walked up to my beloved Hoppit's enclosure he was nowhere to be seen. Oh no! Where had he gone?!
