page_text:

P1	It happened one year that the rain didn't fall. The trees dried up and died. @@The rivers disappeared and the water evaporated. @@People and animals were dying from hunger and thirst.
P2	The chief animals met to talk about the situation. @@Lion said, "Let's call everyone together and discuss the idea of digging a well. We can drink from its waters."@@Elephant agreed and went off to spread the news to the other animals.
P3	All the animals gathered to discuss the situation. @@Lion began, saying, "My brothers and sisters, this year the rain has not fallen. Everyone is dying from hunger and thirst. Let us dig a well so that we can all drink from it."
P4	The animals all agreed and immediately grabbed hoes, shovels and picks. They started digging a well.
P5	Hare had not come, but the other animals continued without him. They dug. And they dug. And they dug some more. And finally they hit water. @@When they struck water, Lion said, "Why did Hare not come to help? He will not drink from this water!"
P6	Later Hare came and saw the well. He said, "Hello?" But he heard nothing. @@So he went in and splashed around in the water for a while.
P7	The next day, when the animals came, they saw that their well was a big mess. The water was nothing but mud. They asked, "Who would do such a thing?" @@Someone said, "I bet it was Hare, because when we were digging the well he was nowhere to be found."
P8	The animals decided to leave a guard at the well. They chose Baboon to keep an eye on things. @@Hare came to the well that night, and said, "Hello?" And Baboon replied, "Hello!" So Hare came over to Baboon, saying "Try this!" @@Hare gave Baboon some honey. And Baboon let him take some water. Just then, Hyena arrived and saw Hare drinking.
P9	The next day, Hyena went and told all the animals that Hare had taken water from the well. They chose Turtle to guard the well. @@Turtle was on the job when Hare arrived at night, saying, "Hello?" He didn't hear a sound.@ @He started talking to himself, "Lucky me! I've come to have a little drink."
P10	When Turtle had arrived at the well, she had hidden herself among the rocks. She looked just like another rock. @@As soon as Hare started to go into the water, Turtle grabbed Hare by the leg. @@Hare said, "Oops, you didn't grab me. You've grabbed a stick!" But Turtle didn't say a word. She stayed there holding onto Hare until the sunrise.
P11	When Lion arrived, he saw that Turtle had captured Hare. He called the rest of the animals to decide what to do with Hare. @@When all the animals were assembled, Lion asked them, "What shall we do with Hare?"@@Turtle said, "I want Elephant to grab him with her trunk and beat him on rocks." All the other animals agreed.
P12	Hare quickly said, "O Great Lion, you know that hares don't die if you hit them on rocks. A hare will only die if he is thrown into ashes."@@So, Lion told Elephant to grab Hare. Elephant picked him up and started hitting him in a pile of ash from a fire.
P13	After Hare was completely covered in ashes, Elephant threw him. @@As Hare landed he made a big cloud of dust! When the animals saw the dust they really laughed.
P14	When the dust settled, the animals looked around and Hare was gone! @@And then they knew that Hare had tricked them again.
