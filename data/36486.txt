desc:	About a girl who is poor and then a shooting star turns her life upside down

page_text:

P1	Once lived  a poor girl named Natasha. Natasha  loved to sit outside in the fresh air at night to see the beautiful shooting star pass by as she wished her wish.
P2	Her wish was to live a great life as a billionaire. On Monday when Natasha went to school she saw  her best friend Lila. Lila was the only one that didn't make fun Natasha, she was always threre to help her when other students bullied her.
P3	"How was your weekend" asked Lila, "It was fine, but it wasn't the best." As the bell rang the two best friends waved goodbye and went to class. "Take out your geography books, said  Mrs Abaru. @"Umm, Mrs Abaru I forgot to do my homework."
P4	"Why didn't you do your homework?" shouted the teacher. "This is the 9th time that you didn't do your homework" claimed Mrs  Abaru. "Go do your homework outside, now!"
P5	After a few classes it was time to go home. Lila was coming over to Natasha's house to help her with homework. After they were done they went to the most biggest store around. They looked at a dress and knew that they couldn't afford it.
P6	After a few hours looking at the pink beautiful dress the two best friends headed home. Lila went back to her house. When Natasha went home, she ate leftovers from the fridge. She ate leftovers because she wanted her mom to save some money.
P7	Yayyy, shouted Natasha's mother. Why are you shouting so early in the morning mother,Natasha said as she woke up. Natasha, I just won, what did you win? I won the lottery! That's great news Mom. Now you won't have to eat leftovers anymore.
P8	"I need to talk to you Lila " Natasha said,  I'm@listening claimed Lila. Yesterday my mom won the lottery! This means we can move to a new house and we can get the dress that we wanted. Great for you Natasha,  Lila said sadly.
P9	Why are you sad Lila? I'm sad because my mom is sick and we can't afford to go to the hospital. "Hey who said that Im keeping all that money to myself. My mother and I decided to share the money with you and your Mom. Thank you so much Nat!
P10	Lila started to cry with tears of joy. A few moments later, they went to the biggest store around and bought the beautiful dresses and all the stuff they wanted. And so the shooting star granted her wish after all.  They lived happily rich.
