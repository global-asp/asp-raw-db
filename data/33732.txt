P1	Once upon a time, there was a girl named Kay. @@Kay's parents were brilliant scientists. They were working on a top secret project in their laboratory.
P2	An evil scientist called Dr Devious wanted to know the secret of the secret project. @@One dark night, Dr Devious sent her accomplice Dan Diabolical to kidnap Kay's parents.
P3	Dan got the parents. He almost got Kay, but she was small and fast. She managed to slip through his fingers. @@Kay ran like a lightening bolt.
P4	When she stopped running, Kay found herself in a dark forest surrounded by trees.@@As she looked up to see the sky, Kay tripped and fell!
P5	She fell down, down, down, and bumped her head.@@When Kay woke up, she was in a nice room with a big TV.
P6	"Hello Kay," said the man on the TV. @@"I am a secret agent for World Good! You are our newest secret agent!" @@With those words, Kay grew as brave as a wolf.
P7	Agent Kay left the tree through a  door in the trunk. @@She ran to where Dr Devious lived and dared her to a duel. @@They fought for two days, until Kay was victorious!
P8	After her parents returned home, Kay went to the tree to find the man on TV.@@She found the tree, but there was no door.@@Kay sat down and looked up into the trees.
