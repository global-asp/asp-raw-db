page_text:

P1	I wonder if there's another me somewhere in the world.
P2	Who looks the same.
P3	And talks the same.
P4	And even has my curls.
P5	Someone with my eyes my ears.
P6	Who even has my laugh.
P7	Who can do what I can do.
P8	And can't do what I can't.
P9	I've looked and looked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behind the trees.
P10	I looked around,  up and down.
P11	At every single face.
P12	I couldn't find another me in any single place.
P13	There's only one me in the world! I'm special,  oh it's true!
P14	But not just me,  don't you see? There's only one of you!
