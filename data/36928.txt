page_text:

P1	Chapter 1: A  new pup@Madame le puff was at the door, gazing at the sun. She always did this. And always kept quiet. This time she groaned and went back inside.
P2	Later on, Madame Le puff was lying on her couch sniffing the air. Then there was a knock at the door. Who could that be? She wondered to herself as she got up.
P3	No one was at the door. But a box that is.... What could be in the box?!  That was what Madame Le puff was thinking. She brought the box inside.
P4	The box had a label which read out: I found this little guy in the woods, I think he's  lost. Please take care of him. From:Sophie. P.S: His name is Meeka. Madame le puff hesitated and opened the box.
P5	A small head popped out of the box. It was an afghan hound puppy. Madame le puff shrieked. She hated afghan hounds. And Sophie knew that. Because Madame le puff told her that a billion times!
P6	WHY CAN'T YOU DO IT SOPHIE? IT'S JUST A STUPID OLD MUTT! said Madame le puff crossly.  Madame le puff lived alone. And she'd always liked being alone, and this pup really upset her.
P7	She threw Meeka into the box and kicked the box across the floor. She climbed back onto the couch and continued her angry day.
P8	Chapter 2: The naughty pup@Madame le puff finally decided to give Meeka a chance. Uhhhhhhhh hello..... said Madame le puff nervously. Meeka farted. Ewwwwwwwwwww! Screamed Madame le puff.  She hated bad smells too.
P9	GOOD MORNING MEEKA!!!!!  She growled at him. He farted again. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!!!! she roared at him. Meeka burst into tears.  He could only slightly manage to say Owwwwww! WHY?! But Madame le puff was already on the couch.
P10	Meeka cried and cried until Madame le puff  got frustrated. FINE!!!!!!She yelled. I'll paint with you she said quietly.
P11	They went to the table and got out paper and Madame le puff's paints. Let's  draw a flower she said in her quietest voice.
P12	But Meeka had different ideas. He dipped his paws in the paint. Aaaaaaaah, sticky! He yelled. Madame le puff  ran into the bathroom to get a tissue.  Meeka rubbed his paws on the shiny table.
P13	When Madame le puff  came back she was shocked to see paint on her shiniest table. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!!! she yelled. Meeka folded back his ears and grinned. Painting! He said happily. Madame le puff  sighed.
P14	There's  a lot you need to learn she said.
P15	Chapter 3:  Meeka's punishment @Bad pup!!!! She growled at Meeka. What did I do? Asked Meeka puzzled.
P16	WELL, she said. I always wanted a pup, but..... You have one! Said Meeka frowning. I hate afghan hounds!!!! She yelled. Here is your punishment: Go away forever!!!! She roared.
P17	Meeka frowned, folded his ears back and cried. He slowly walked away feeling very upset and starving.
P18	Meeka couldn't believe his ears what he heard.
P19	Chapter 4: Lost (again) @Eventually, Meeka arrived in a very strange place called Fuzzy land. Meeka tried to go into every house he could see but got kicked out.
P20	He was out of hope. He started to cry. He heard a noise. His ear twitched.
P21	Ay, Fuzzy pants! Came a voice. Meeka walked up the road. And what he saw was the oddest looking house he had ever seen!
P22	Can I come in? Squeaked Meeka. No one said a thing, but a fuzzy paw swung the door open. Meeka crept inside.
P23	Inside Meeka smelt fox, chicken and sausages. He felt very welcome here. Hello, Hello! I'm  Selena the blue heeler said an extremely  large dog.
P24	Chapter 5: Life @So what's  your name, kid? Said Selena. Meeka said Meeka. Are you hungry, Meeka? Asked Selena. Ooh, yes said Meeka. Thank you for asking he said politely. So they ran off to the dinner table.
P25	Meeka ate a rather large selection of food. Beef, chicken,  fox, dead cat and half a lamb. Boy, was he full!
P26	Meeka had never enjoyed himself that much before with food.
P27	Now, is this the right pup? He asked himself. This is yummy!!!! I'm  quiet stuffed too though he said. Keep room for dessert! Yelled Selena. It's  Sticky Toffee pudding! She whispered. Yum!!!!!
P28	Meeka stayed with Selena for a few years and   she never growled, yelled or smacked him. Meeka loved Selena.
P29	Chapter 6: Meeka is sad@Then Meeka cried. Why am I crying????!!!!! Shrieked  Meeka. He continued crying. He curled up in a ball.
P30	Why are you crying Sweetie? Asked Selena. I don't know said Meeka. Something feels different he said.
P31	Meeka did know what it was and  why he was crying: He missed Madame le puff.  But he was too upset to tell Selena.
P32	Finally, Meeka came downstairs.  What happened, child? Asked Selena. I can't tell you said Meeka. Of course you can!!! Said Selena.  No, I  can't  said Meeka. TELL ME!!!! roared Selena.
P33	NO!!!! yelled Meeka. You'll  be sad. Selena growled. TELL ME RIGHT NOW!!!! she growled. She put her nail on Meeka's tail and wouldn't  let go.
P34	Meeka screamed and cried and he scratched Selena on the nose! Selena burst into tears. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
P35	Chapter 7: The truth @Selena ran upstairs crying. Meeka ran after her. Selena slammed the door in his face.
P36	Meeka opened the door. Selena? he said. WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!!! asked Selena. I'm  sorry he said.
P37	The truth is.... I miss Madame le puff  said Meeka. She was quite rude but  :(  I miss her.
P38	Selena lifted her head and said: It's  ok to feel homesick but you should of told me. Meeka  folded back his ears.
P39	Chapter 8: The plan @So what if I let you go back? Selena asked. Oh I'd  be so thankful said Meeka  and blushed ðŸ˜Š
P40	Ok in two days you go back ok? Said Selena. I won't  miss you anyway!!!! She was being sarcastic. Meeka laughed.
P41	Yes! I like this idea he said. They Highfived and went to bed.
P42	Chapter 9: The birthday @Meeka scrolled on his calendar.
P43	Oh yeah, tomorrow's my birthday! He said. Hurrah!
P44	Chapter 10: Love sweet love @Finally, they arrived back at Ireland. Meeka's tail wiggled wildly.
P45	He knocked at Madame le puff's house.
P46	Madame le puff opened the door.
P47	You came back for me. Why? She asked. Meeka blushed. ðŸ˜Š
P48	I was so mean to you!!!! She yelled. Yes but..... I love you!!!! He said. Madame le puff stopped. Nobody had told her they loved her before.
P49	She started crying (happy tears) Meeka leaned into her arm and hugged it.
