desc:	Jesus parable of the rich fool illustrated as if it happened in Africa.

page_text:

P1	The land of a certain rich man produced an abundant crop.
P2	The rich man thought to himself,  "What should I do,  for I have nowhere to store my crops?"
P3	Then he said,  "I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones,  and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
P4	And I will say to myself,  "You have plenty of goods stored up for many years;  relax,  eat,  drink,  celebrate!"
P5	But God said to him,  "You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you,  but who will get what you have prepared for yourself?"
P6	So it is with the one who stores up riches for himself,  but is not rich toward God.
P7	After telling this story,  Jesus said to his disciples: Therefore I tell you,  do not worry about your life,  what you will eat,  or about your body,  what you will wear.
P8	For there is more to life than food,  and more to the body than clothing.
P9	Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap,  they have no storeroom or barn,  yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!
P10	And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life? So if you cannot do such a very little thing as this,  why do you worry about the rest?
P11	Consider how the flowers grow; they do not work or spin. Yet I tell you,  not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these! And if this is how God clothes the wild grass,  which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven,  how much more will he clothe you,  you people of little faith!
P12	So do not be overly concerned about what you will eat and what you will drink,  and do not worry about such things. For all the nations of the world pursue these things,  and your Father knows that you need them.
P13	Instead,  pursue his kingdom,  and these things will be given to you as well. Luke 12: 16-31.
