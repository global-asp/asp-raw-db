page_text:

P1	Once there was an annoying little brat named Saara drawing on her  drawing book. Sometimes she is a good person but most of the time demonic devil. She went to her dad for an iPhone 11 but he said then she screamed until she got it.🐷
P2	Once she got the phone she decided to show of to her friend (I'm surprised she even has friends) and she totally rubed it in her face. Then she went around the hole neighbourhood showing off her phone (did you know she had a jump rope to).
