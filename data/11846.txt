page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived a cat in our home. The rats were very terrible. They would play in the food.
P2	The cat ran after the rats and they hid in their holes. They also ate people's toes.
P3	They also ate our food. They ate our fish,  sweet potatoes,  and other things. One day,  the cat ate some rats. All the rats hid in their caves for some short days.
P4	Then the rats came back. So we tried to spread poison,  but the rats didn't stop. We also trapped the rats and we killed some rats.
P5	But they did not stop. We could not stop the rats. The rats were winners and we were losers.
P6	This is the end of the story. Bye,  cat and rats!
