P1	*SECTION* — GAMES FOR ADDING AND SUBTRACTING@@Prerequisite: Ability to do single-digit addition and subtraction using manipulatives@@GAME — CARDS TO A TARGET@@Start by laying out all the playing cards from 1 to 5 in a 4 by 5 grid. Start the running total at 0 and choose a target number, say 25. Players take turns choosing and turning over one of the numbers and adding that number to the running total. The last player to pick a number that does not run over the target number wins.@@Replace using 1 to 5 with any set of five numbers you want practice adding. To practice subtraction, start at the target number, subtract the selected numbers, and don't allow going below 0.
P2	GAME — COMBO DOMINOES@@Use a set of dominoes that either go from 1 to 6 or 1 to 9. Each player starts with 5 random dominoes without letting the other player see them. The aim of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their dominoes.@@To start, a random domino is placed face up in the middle. After that, a player must match the top domino in the middle. Matching means that the two numbers on the top domino can be combined with any operation — add, subtract, or even multiply if you want — to make the same result as some, possibly different, operation acting on the two numbers of one of your dominoes. The new domino is placed on top of the previous top. If you can't make a match, you must pick up a new domino from the pile.
P3	GAME — PART-WHOLE TRIANGLES@@Use number cards 1 to 13. To start, each player is dealt 6 cards face up. There is a draw pile with one card turned over to start a discard pile. @@During a turn, a player takes the top discard card or the unknown card at the top of the draw pile. The chosen card must replace a card they already have, and the replaced card is discarded. The goal for each player is to create a 6-card pyramid where each card is the sum of the two below it. The first player to achieve this wins. @@Experiment with smaller or larger ranges of cards to accommodate the skills of younger or older players.
P4	GAME — GET OUT OF MY HOUSE — ADD/SUB@@Use a deck of cards with numbers from 1 (Ace) to 10. On a shared piece of paper, draw 20 boxes or simple houses numbered from 0 to 19. Each player has 7 tokens distinct from the other player's 7 tokens.@@During a turn, a player selects two random cards, and can choose to add, subtract, or multiply them to put their token in a house with fewer than three of the opponent's tokens. If the house contains one or two of the opponent's tokens, those tokens are given back to the opponent and the player says "Get out of my house." The first player to put all their tokens in houses wins.
P5	*SECTION* — SKIP COUNTING@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers, beginning place value@@ACTIVITY — SKIP COUNTING@@Your child has already practiced skip counting, probably by 2's, 5's, and 10's between 0 and 20. Now is the time to start practicing general skip counting by any number from any number.@@Skip counting up and down by single-digit numbers helps with adding and subtracting, as well as multiplication and division. This is a lot to learn, so please expect it to take time. The tricky part in skip counting is when the tens digit changes, so be sure to focus on that. This is a handy activity to do when you are traveling or waiting around with some extra time.@@Skip counting by 10's is tied to understanding that two-digit numbers are made up of a tens place and a ones place. Skip counting by 10's will be easier if your child can look at a 100-chart.
P6	GAME — SHORT STEPS TO A TARGET@@Create a random 2-digit starting number using two playing cards from 1 to 9 — the first card will give you the tens place and the other the ones place. Starting at that number, you are allowed to use a total of 5 jumps each of which is either by 1 or 10. The goal is to get as close to 50 as possible, and the score is the difference from 50. The lowest total score after several rounds wins.@@Young players benefit from referring to a 100-chart. Using that chart will also emphasize place value as they go up or down by 10.@@You can vary this game by allowing steps of 1, 2 or 10, or steps of 1, 2, 5, or 10. Also, use target numbers other than 50 sometimes.
P7	PUZZLE — ISLAND HOPPING — SKIP COUNTING@@These puzzles have islands (circles) connected by bridges (lines). In this version, the connections are made by skip counting. Some of the islands have numbers written on them and some will start off blank. Above the puzzle is the starting number, ending number, and the skip amount. The challenge is to fill in the missing numbers and find the path. You can also place the numbers and blanks on the floor to make a stepping puzzle.
P8	As with the Skip Counting activity, create puzzles to practice going forward or backward starting at a variety of numbers, not just numbers that are a multiple of the skip amount.@@Create these puzzles by making the islands first, filling in the skip counting numbers, connecting those islands in the correct order, and then adding some additional connections to help make a puzzle out of it. In the version you give your child, remove some numbers leaving enough of the numbers so that it can still be figured out.
P9	*SECTION* — DO SUM PLAY@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers@@GAME — MATH TIC TAC TOE@@Use a Tic-Tac-Toe board and tokens with the numbers from 1 to 9 on them. One player has the odd numbers and the other the even ones. Players take turns placing a token, with the Odd player going first. The first player to complete 3 in a row whose sum is 15 wins. One variation is to keep going, fill all the squares, and see which player made the most 15's.@@A related game is to have an attacker and a defender. The attacker goes first (the first move cannot be a 5 in the center) and tries to get 15, and the defender tries to stop the attacker.
P10	GAME — MEMORY CHALLENGE REVISITED@@There are many versions of this game. The idea is always the same: deal a grid of cards face down, say 4 by 4, and the players take turns turning over two cards. If the cards match, the player keeps the cards, two more cards are dealt into the empty spaces, and the player gets another turn. If the cards don't match, the cards are turned back over and the player's turn ends. The player with the most cards wins.@@Here are other ideas for how cards can match:@@    • Use a target sum — two cards match if their sum is the target.@    • Use a target difference — two cards match if their difference is the target.@    • Use cards with addition or subtraction problems together with cards that have the answers — cards match if the problem matches the answer.
P11	GAME — PAIRING DOWN@@Start with a number line that goes from 1 to some number, say 20. During a turn, choose two numbers and a result, none of which have been crossed out, and write down an addition or subtraction equation that involves those numbers. The two numbers in the equation are crossed off, and the result is circled. @@The next player must use the result as one of the two numbers. If it is played competitively, the winner is the last player with a legal move. It can also be played cooperatively to see how few numbers are left untouched.
P12	PUZZLE — FIX IT@@This starts with a 4 by 4 grid of numbers with a target sum. The challenge is to find entries to remove so that the sum of the remaining numbers in every row and column is the target. An alternative version uses individual target sums for each row and column.@@Make these puzzles by putting in pairs or triples of numbers that sum to the target sum. Then fill in the remaining spaces with decoy numbers.
P13	*SECTION* — EXPANDED FORM AND PLACE VALUE@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers, beginning place value@@ACTIVITY — FOLDING EXPANDED FORM@@This helpful device shows how two-digit numbers are formed from tens and ones.@@Take a piece of paper that exactly fits four Number Cards side by side. Mark the paper with:  - "0" - "+" - . It should have vertical folds on both sides of the "+" sign. Paper clip numbers to the two spaces. For example, if you use 2 and 3, folded up this looks like 23, but unfolded this becomes 20+3.
P14	ACTIVITY — I'M THINKING OF A NUMBER@@One player thinks of a number between 0 and 99. The other player figures out the number by asking questions about the tens and ones digits.@@Suppose the number is 23. The player could ask if the tens digit is bigger than or equal to the ones digit — it isn't for 23. The player could ask if the sum of the two digits is less than 8 — it is for 23. The player could then ask if twice the tens digit is bigger than the ones digit — it is. At this point, the number must be 23 or 34. Asking if the sum of the digits is less than 6 finishes things off.@@The types of questions can be anything the players agree to, but it is best if the questions involve the ones and tens digits.
P15	GAME — MEMORY GAME — EXPANDED FORM@@Select 20 numbers from 0 to 99. Write those numbers on pieces of paper (cards). For each of those numbers, write an expanded form of that number on a card. For example, create 50 + 3 for 53, 30 + 0 for 30, and 0 + 7 for 7. Take those two decks of 20 cards and shuffle them together. Now play the Memory Challenge game as usual, where matches occur when a regular number is paired with its expanded form.
P16	PUZZLE — ISLAND HOPPING BY ONES AND TENS@@A rectangular grid of numbers is given with some of the numbers filled in. The challenge is to fill in the remaining numbers so that any two numbers that share a side only differ in a single place, and the difference of the digits in that place is 1 (including going between 0 and 9). No number may be used more than once in the grid. Using a 100-Chart may be helpful for beginning solvers.@@Make this puzzle by taking an empty grid and filling it with numbers, with no number repeated. Next, remove some of the numbers, making sure that it is not too hard for your child. In the example, the red numbers are the missing ones.
P17	*SECTION* — COMPARING DOUBLE-DIGIT NUMBERS@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers, beginning place value@@GAME — GET CLOSEST@@Write the numbers 5, 10, 25, and 50 vertically on a piece of paper. Put a single blank space on each side of the 5, and two blank spaces on each side of the other numbers. One player fills in the blanks on the left side and the other fills the other side. Each player also has one extra blank to use once with a number to ignore.@@Play with a deck of Number Cards from 0 to 9. Randomly pick a card from the deck, and put it back in after it is used. Both players must use that number somewhere in the spaces that haven't been filled in yet. Once all the spaces are filled, the player's values are compared to each of the target numbers.
P18	Whichever player gets closest to each target number gets a point, with both players getting a point if they are equally close. Whoever has the most points wins.@@Vary this game by having a different set of target numbers. You can also choose to score the game by summing up all the errors for each player. For this, the player with the smaller score wins.@@GAME — WAR — DOUBLE-DIGIT COMPARISON@@Shuffle a deck of playing cards with the face cards and tens removed, and split it evenly between two players. Each player turns over two cards and puts them side by side to form a two-digit number. The player with the larger number keeps all four cards. If there is a tie, each player turns over two more cards with the winner getting all eight cards. After one or more passes through the cards, the player with the most cards wins.
P19	GAME — MATH BLACKJACK@@Traditionally, the target number is 21, but for a young child use a smaller number such as 12. Adjust the contents of the playing cards for your child. For example, for a very young child this might be the cards 1 to 4 in the four suits. @@Two cards are dealt to each player — one is face up and one is face down (the receiving player is the only one to look at the face down card). During a turn, the player has the option of asking for one more card until the player decides to stop. After every player has had a turn, the players compare the sum of their cards. The player with the sum closest to the target without going over wins.
P20	GAME — FILL IN THE BLANKS COMPARISON@@Shuffle a deck of playing cards with the numbers 1 to 9. Deal two cards to each player face down. Then, each player turns over one card and decides whether that card will be the tens or ones card. After deciding, each player's remaining card is turned over and is used to fill the remaining place. The player with the larger number wins. You can also play that the smaller number wins. You can decide whether it is more dramatic to show the cards as they are turned over, or wait until all the decisions are made and the final numbers are formed.@@To practice a bit of addition, as well as making the decisions trickier, draw three cards to turn over one at a time to form a two-digit number and a single-digit number. The goal is to create the largest sum of the two numbers.
