P1	——We are having a family meeting.There is Dad, Auntie Pula, Uncle Chavani, Eddie, Attie, me, and Grandma.I am the youngest.
P2	The radio is on in my house 24/7. We always listen to the news.We heard today that schools are going to re-open next week.
P3	Schools were closed for months because of lockdown.Dad begins, “Family, we need to make a decision about the children going back to school.”
P4	Auntie Pula is worried. “When schools open it means that more people will be infected.Things could get worse,” she says.
P5	Attie says, “I am afraid of getting this disease.Let us wait two weeks to see how things are going at school. There is a lot of confusion.”
P6	Dad says, “I am afraid for Grandma.If the children get the disease and bring it home, it will be really serious for her.”Grandma nods.
P7	My Grandma is elderly. She has diabetes and a heart condition.I am very afraid. I am worried about my family.
P8	Uncle Chavani says, “I think the children should stay home, as a precaution. Let us wait and see if schools are ready for students.”Everyone agrees except Eddie.
P9	“I am supposed to go to High School next year.I do not know if I can cover the work.Online learning is not favourable to me,” says Eddie.
P10	I am not concerned about falling back on schoolwork.I am concerned about humanity. How are we going to treat each other now?We need to face this together.
P11	QuestionsWrite the meaning of these words: infected, elderly, precaution, humanity.Explain what it means to be ‘concerned about humanity’.What decision do you think the family made? Why?
