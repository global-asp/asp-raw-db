P1	Chapter 5 — I CAN COUNT TO 100!@@Prerequisite: Can count to 100 comfortably and have a good sense of those quantities, especially using place value. Mental single-digit addition and subtraction is also sollid.@@— WHERE YOU'VE BEEN —@@Your child can now count to 100! They can comfortably do mental single-digit addition and subtraction. They can also count or skip count up or down by any number, and tied to that skill is their ability to add or subtract a single-digit number with a double-digit number. They can compare two double-digit numbers, and they have a beginning sense of place value with 10's and 1's and of what expanded form is all about.@@As their skip counting is improving, they are also developing skills with multiplying by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10. The idea of even and odd numbers now makes a lot more sense to them.
P2	Some activities from earlier chapters can be extended to the larger numbers here. Look at Chapter 3: Shape Sums, Going Up Some More; Chapter 4: War - Double Digit Add and Subtract, DiffTriangles and SumTriangles, Fix It, Island Hopping by 1's and 10's, Fill in the Blanks Comparison, Sum Square, and Addition Pyramid.@@— New IDEAS IN THIS CHAPTER —@@    • Counting to 200 — It's time to introduce the 100's place by looking at the numbers from 100 to 200.@@    • Skip Counting to 100 — This is not new, but it is an important skill to reinforce.@@    • Expanded Form and Place Value — This is a foundational skill, so it will be reinforced further.
P3	• Double-Digit Addition and Subtraction — Skip counting will help make this seem effortless.@@    • All Single-Digit Multiplication — It is time to fill in the missing gaps for 6, 7, 8, and 9.@@    • Rectangle Area is Length x Width — This is an important idea in its own right. This fact will also provide many opportunities for fun new games and puzzles involving multiplication and factoring.@@    • Factoring — Your child will learn the beauty of how numbers break apart into factors. There are several new words here. 1 is a unit. A number bigger than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself is prime. A number bigger than 1 that is not prime is composite. 3 squared is 3 x 3. 3 cubed is 3 x 3 x 3. And 3 raised to a power, means to multiply 3 by itself that many times - for example, 3 to the fourth is 3 x 3 x 3 x 3.
P4	• Factors, Divisors, and Multiples — 3 divides evenly into 12. That makes 3 a factor or divisor of 12, and 12 a multiple of 3. 3 is a common factor of 12 and 15, and 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.@@    • Single-Digit Division — Your child will learn division indirectly in the form of finding a missing factor in a multiplication problem.@@    • Fact Families for Multiplication and Division — The connection between these two operations will be reinforced. For example, these four facts form a fact family:@@2 x 5 = 10@5 x 2 = 10@10 / 2 = 5@10 / 5 = 2
P5	*SECTION* — MENTAL MULTIPLICATION@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers, skip counting, and doubling@@— INTRODUCTION —@@These teaching methods provide structured strategies for learning single-digit multiplication. As your child practices these strategies they will be learning important numerical relationships, and they will also eventually memorize these facts. Your child should already be good with doubling and skip counting by any number. @@— 3 x 4 = 4 x 3 —@@By now, your child is so familiar with addition that it's no surprise that 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. Although not as obvious, the same is true for multiplication. The illustration on the next page makes it easy to see that two rows of three is the same as three rows of two — you just change your point of view!
P6	This means your child needs to master only about half as many multiplication facts – once they know 3 x 4, they also know 4 x 3.@@— SKIP COUNTING IS MULTIPLYING —@@Skip counting is great for getting better at addition and subtraction, and is a big help in getting started with multiplication.@@Although skip counting is not the fastest way to find a result, it is reliable and your child should use it as long as they need to. Suppose your child needs to find 7 x 3. Skip count by 3's seven times or skip count by 7's three times to get 21.@@— MULTIPLYING BY 5 AND 10@@These facts are quickly learned, provide a backbone for other multiplication facts, and help with understanding two-digit place value.
P7	— SQUARES —@@Just as addition twins are favorite math facts for addition, squares are often favorites for multiplication. Learning these provides another foundation for learning other multiplication facts.@@— DOUBLING —@@Use this strategy for multiplying by even numbers. For example, the result of 6 x 7 is the double of 3 x 7. So, 6 x 7 is the double of 21, which is 42.@@— 1 MORE OR 1 LESS —@@This strategy is effective for the remaining multiplication facts. For example, 9 x 7 is one 7 less than 10 x 7 = 70. So it is 70 - 7 = 63. This can be done for all the 9's. Similarly, 3 x 7 is one more 7 than doubling 7, so it is 7 + 14 = 21. This can be done for all the 3's.@@— MULTIPLYING BY 9 —@@If you write out the multiples of 9 in order, you'll see that the tens digit is always one less than the number you are multiplying by and the ones digit plus the tens digit always adds up to 9!
P8	*SECTION* — PLACE VALUE, ADD, AND SUBTRACT@@Prerequisite: Having a sense of 2-digit place value and how that relates to addition and comparisons.@@GAME — STAKE YOUR CLAIM@@Have a paper with a number line from 0 to 99 to share. On a turn, a player uses two random cards from 0 to 9, choosing the order of these two digits, to generate a number from 00 to 99, and then puts that number on their side of the number line. The first player to get four numbers in a region without any of the opponent's numbers in between wins. The game can also be played from 000 to 999 if you like.
P9	GAME — MAKING 100@@Each player has a sheet of paper with 7 rows and 3 columns. The columns are marked "10's," "1's," and "Running Total." Each player's running total starts at 0. Roll a die or pick a random playing card from 1 to 9. Each player chooses to use this number in their 1's or 10's column for the current row. For example, if it is a 4, this can become 4 or 40. The chosen number is added to the running total. A player that goes over the target of 100 "goes bust" and loses. If neither player goes bust, the one closer to 100 wins. @@There are many options for this game:@@    • Use a different target number.@    • Use fewer or more rows.@    • Don't go bust if you go over the target. The closer player on either side wins.@    • Use a fourth column of 100's to practice 3-digit numbers.@    • Practice subtraction by starting at the target number and subtracting down to 0.
P10	PUZZLE — BONDED GROUPS@@There are two versions of this. The first is the same as the Sum Groups puzzle in Chapter 3, only now the target sums can be bigger. @@The other version uses a 4 by 4 board with a target number, say 20. As in Sum Groups, the board is filled with pairs and triples of numbers that add up to the target. However, now there will be one square not involved in any of those groups. The challenge is to find that number.
P11	PUZZLE — MISSING NUMBERS@@Create these by taking a simple addition or subtraction equation and leaving out some of the digits. For example, the following two problems are turned into Missing Number puzzles by leaving out a couple digits.@@After getting comfortable with these, your child may enjoy doing some Letter Substitution puzzles that are described on a later Adding and Subtracting page in this chapter.
P12	*SECTION* — MULTIPLICATION CARDS AND TABLES@@Prerequisite: Increasing comfort with single-digit multiplication for all numbers@@ACTIVITY — MAKING MULTIPLICATION CARDS@@Make a set of multiplication cards to practice these math facts while playing matching games your family played earlier: Chapter 1 — Go Fish, Memory Challenge; Chapter 2 — Bingo; Chapter 3 — Hot Potato; and Chapter 4 — Gin Rummy.@@Hand draw four cards to go with each math fact — 1) the expression 2) groups of objects, 3) an array, and 4) the prime factorization.@@Take 3 x 4 for example. These would be the four cards.
P13	You have several options for these cards. One option is to include 3 x 4 and not include 4 x 3. While this means you make about half as many cards, it has the drawback that seeing 3 groups of 4 is different from seeing 4 groups of 3.@@For array cards, put the skip counting numbers along one or both of the sides to help your child practice skip counting.@@For expression cards, replace each number with the prime factorization symbol for the number. This makes it easier to see how the prime factorizations fit together when multiplying two numbers.
P14	PUZZLE — REVEALING PRODUCTS@@Start with a blank multiplication table that has 4 product rows and 4 product columns. There are also groups of four missing numbers at the top and left sides – these will have some of the numbers from 2 to 9, and these numbers can be duplicated. @@Fill in the table out of sight of your child, and then flip over or cover all the numbers. Your child can ask to reveal, one at a time, up to 10 of the 16 product entries. The goal is to figure out the entries for the top and left sides before running out of turns.@@Larger sizes also work. For example, a table with 5 blank rows and columns that allows for up to 12 flips will work well.@@Pick numbers for the top and left sides that you want your child to practice with.
P15	Imagine that all the cards were flipped over in this example. If your child chose to flip over the card that happened to have the 63 under it, then they would know it came from a  7 and a 9. Flipping over any other card in the same row or column as the 63 would indicate where the 7 and 9 are. Suppose the second card they flipped over was where the 56 is. Not only would they know that the third column was for 7, they would also know that the second row was for 9 and the third row was for 8.
P16	*SECTION* — FACTORS, MULTIPLES, AND PRIMES@@Prerequisite: Increasing comfort with single-digit multiplication for all numbers@@GAME — NIM WITH FACTORS@@Start with any number, say 20. Let your child decide whether to go first or second. During their turn, a player may subtract any divisor of the current number from the number. The player forced to 0 loses.@@After your child becomes familiar with the game, encourage them to look for the remarkably simple strategy for playing it - once they discover it, see if they can explain why it works.
P17	GAME — COVER FACTORS AND MULTIPLES@@Have a board of numbers from 1 to 30. There are two kinds of tokens — a single token reserved for "the last move," and a pile of other tokens. @@The first player gets to pick any number and cover it with the last move token. After that, a player replaces the last move token with the other type of token and moves the last move token to any number that is a factor or multiple of the number from the last move. The losing player is the one forced to cover the number 1. @@As children get better at this game, they will discover rules they need to follow governing reasonable first moves. The most basic rule is that the first move cannot be on a prime number in the upper half of the numbers.@@Adjust the range of numbers for the skill level of the players — you can use 1 to 24, 1 to 48, or even 1 to 60.
P18	ACTIVITY — SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENES@@Children have fun putting in X's and watching the primes fall through the sieve. This activity creates opportunities for discovering many interesting properties of divisibility and primes.@@Start with a number line numbered from 1 to 25 — or a larger range if space and patience allows. @@Write the number 2 below itself. On the line even with this 2, put X's below each multiple of 2.@@Now, pull down the lowest number with no X's below it (3 in this case) and put it on the next line. Write the 3 and put X's on that line for all its multiples. Keep pulling down numbers and marking their multiples.
P19	When you are finished, you will have pulled down all the primes. Remember that 1 is a unit and not a prime!@@Here are some good questions to discuss with your child as they play with this sieve:@@    • Why are the numbers pulled down primes?@    • What is the last prime whose multiples you need to cross out? Why were the other primes not useful?@    • For all the primes that were useful, which of their multiples produced new restrictions and which were not useful?@    • If you had a number, say 53, which prime numbers would you need to divide it by to confirm that it's a prime?
P20	*SECTION* — MIXED OPERATIONS@@Prerequisite: Comfort with two-digit addition and subtraction, and one-digit multiplication@@ACTIVITY — SECRET OPS@@Near the end of Chapter 4, the Sum Difference activity had one person think of two numbers and then challenge the other person to find the numbers by telling them the sum and difference of the numbers. Secret Ops uses the same idea, only now the challenger can use any two operations, such as multiplying and subtracting.@@For example, the challenger might say "Which two numbers have a product of 12 and a difference of 4?" You can extend this to three numbers, if you like — "Which three numbers have a product of 12 and a sum of 8?"
P21	GAME — MIX IT UP@@Have a collection of numbered cards from 1 to 25, or whatever range your child is comfortable with. A card is selected at random and used as everyone's target number. The card is returned to the deck. Each player is dealt five cards to be used, in any order and with any operations, to get as close as possible to the target number. The closest player wins the round.@@A different way to score gives a player twice as many points as the number of cards they use to reach the target; a player receives 5 points for hitting the target with help; and a player receives 6 points for helping someone hit the target.
P22	INVESTIGATION — LEVER BALANCE@@Use the lever principle to practice multiplication and addition. The principle states that the force exerted by a mass on one side of a lever is equal to the mass times its distance from the pivot point, the fulcrum. The forces on one side from several masses add up to give the total force. The total forces on the two sides must be equal for the lever to be in balance.@@You have a 3-unit weight and a 5-unit weight to put on opposite sides of the fulcrum. Where should they be put to balance? The answer to this can be distances 5 and 3, but it can also be 10 and 6, or even larger answers like 15 and 9.
P23	If you have a 3-unit and a 5-unit weight to put on one side of a lever, which weights can you put at which distances on the other side? What if the two weights are on different sides of the lever? This question continues the questions on the Make It Count page at the end of Chapter 4.@@PUZZLE — PARENTHESES PUZZLES@@These puzzles are very easy for an adult to create. Take any equation, such as 9 = (2 + 7) x (5 - 2 x 2) and remove the parentheses. The challenge for your child is how to take 2 + 7 x 5 - 2 x 2 and add parentheses to it so that the result is 9.
