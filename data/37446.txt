desc:	The story tells of an evil woman

page_text:

P1	There lived a woman in the land of Ikot Akpabio in Etinan, a small village in Akwa Ibom State, named Uyai who was well known for making shoes and bags.@It was told that the people of the land remained astonished at the good number of shoes
P2	she displayed at their market square  every market day.@Uyai was highly placed in the society for attracting a lot of buyers from their neighboring communities, who came in their numbers to exchange their treasures for her shoes and bags.
P3	Uyai seemed very unusual, as many testified that she was blessed with powers from the underworld that made her outstanding amongst her age-grade.@Even with all her strives, little did the  villagers know about who she really was and the
P4	fact that her shoes and bags when bought by her customers, had the power to bring to her everything that is been put inside, which she later would trade them at a higher price.@Many years had passed and Uyai continued to bask in her deeds
P5	until her actions were made public. She was banished from the village and her goods were never to be sold or bought again.@This probably was her fate, as her grandfather (The Great Obong Usoro) had earlier warned her of the recompense for
P6	using the power for evil and not for good.@@Questions@1. Who was Uyai?@2. What was her occupation?@3. What did you learn from the story?
