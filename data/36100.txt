desc:	Will Abla be able to go to school

page_text:

P1	There was a girl named Abla. She prayed to Allah to prevent her period from coming because she knew she would have to get married. @@Abla didn't want to get married. In fact, she liked reading her brother's school notes a lot!
P2	When her period came, she cried and tried to hide it from her father. But her father found out. He was happy because there was a rich man who wanted to marry Abla. @@"Please don't send me to my husband's house at such a young age," begged Abla. But her father did not agree.
P3	He asked her what she wanted to do instead of marriage. She told him she wanted to go to school like her brother Ibrahim. Her father laughed at her.
P4	"Why do you want to go to school?" he asked her.@@"Baba, I like reading Ibra's notes and I'm sure I'll do well if you allow me join school too."@@"Of what use is education to you?" he asked her.
P5	"Why does Ibrahim go to school then?"@@"He is a man!"@@"Baba, am I not your child too?"
P6	"Ableluwa, you are my daughter. Alhaji Musa is a very rich man! He'll give you everything you need."@@"Baba I don't want his money! I want to go to school!"@@"You will marry him before your next period," her father said and walked out.
P7	That afternoon, on her way to the market, Abla read a pamphlet from a Non-Governmental Organization that encouraged girls to go to school. @@Luckily for her, their address was near the market, so she went there and told them everything. They took an interest in her case and got her a lawyer who threatened to charge her father in court if he didn't allow her to go to school.@@ The lawyer also made sure that she wasn't forced into marriage.
P8	Abla was able to go to school where she was top of her class. She got scholarships to study Law at university. @@Her father was very proud of her and remorseful for almost preventing her destiny.
P9	Today, Abla is a Human Rights activist who helps young girls in the same situation that she was in. @@She wants every girl to know that she is just as important as any boy. We are all equal!
