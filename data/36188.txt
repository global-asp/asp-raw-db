P1	When the magical rainbow water goes out of balance, Samira sends the girls through the waterfall to a new world, Rainbow Zahra may, where they meet a waterfall genie who can help them bring balance to the water.
P2	When they got through the waterfall, their outfits changed, and their hair had Blue and pink.
P3	In rainbow Zahra may, Shimmer wears a purple shirt and a purple tu tu skirt. She looks so adorable in it.
P4	Shine wears a blue shirt and a blue skirt with multi color shoes. She looks cute with some gold on her clothes.
P5	Leah, however, wears a pink and purple shirt with pink pants. She may not be a genie, but she has style.
P6	Together these girls make a great team, but Zeta and Nazboo are still on the hold of them.
P7	From mermaid to fairies, no job is never too hard to handle.
P8	Shimmer and shine and Leah will save the Rainbow waterfall.
