page_text:

P1	This story is about two friends,  Tjenga and Ngu. They understood each other,  played together,  hunted together and shared their food. Tjenga left his family and went to stay with Ngu's family.
P2	Early one morning Tjenga left to hunt in the bush. After searching for some time,  the young hunter found the footprint of an antelope on the ground. It belonged to an eland,  the most beautiful of all antelopes.
P3	Quietly,  Tjenga set his arrow in the bow and pulled until the string was tight and ready. He aimed at the eland's heart. Tjenga released the poison arrow and it flew through the air. The arrow hit the eland's heart.
P4	Tjenga was afraid because he had shot the beautiful eland. He lay down silently in the bush,  resting and waiting for the poison arrow to do its work. The sky and the air around Tjenga shivered from the midday heat while the hunter waited for the eland to die.
P5	When the family got to the hunting ground where Tjenga had shot the eland,  they did not find a dead person there. The father said,  "Did you lie to me?" "No," said the boy,  "I told you about my hunt and the eland man just as I saw it."
P6	Tjenga's family made more fire. They danced all night and celebrated the food that the hunter had brought home. Tjenga's father said to him,  "Now you have learnt a great lesson. You cannot leave your own people and adopt another. When you are in serious trouble,  it is your own people who will help you and not your friends."
