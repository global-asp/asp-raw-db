page_text:

P1	There were two boys living in the same street by the names of Peter and Thabo. They were learning in the same school and both doing grade 4. The boys loved playing soccer together in the open field outside the house, afterschool.
P2	Peter and Thabo have a love of soccer as they started playing soccer when there were still young. As the grew older they began to kick the ball harder. If they kicked harder, the ball would land to Gogo's garden.
P3	Gogo Msila had a garden opposite the field where the boys played. She was living in the same street and loved seeing boys playing soccer but She was worried because boys kicked the ball to her garden most of the time.
P4	In her garden, she had vegetables like carrots, cabbage, beetroots, tomatoes, spinach and green beans still growing.
P5	Gogo would always tell the boys to remember to close the gate after fetching the ball in the garden so that the goats roaming around would not get to the garden and eat her vegetables.
P6	One day, on Thursday afternoon@Gogo was getting ready to see her visitors that were coming from Botswana. She was happy that they were coming and she was planning to make a delicious vegetables stew and a Bigfoot of vegetable soup
P7	She knew exactly what to cook in the following day because her garden had many vegetables. Peter and Thabo were playing soccer as usual. Peter was tried to score the goal. He kicked the ball harder and the ball landed to Gogo's garden.
P8	The boys ran to garden get the ball and went back to the field to continue playing soccer and forgot to close the gate. The goats ate all the vegetables in the garden.
P9	Gogo was very angry at them because she didn't know what to prepare for her visitors. Peter and Thabo apologized to Gogo and promised to close the gate next time if they fetched the ball.
P10	Boys parents and Neighbours helped Gogo by giving her vegetables from their gardens that gogo needed to cook for her visitors. Visitors came and enjoyed a delicious vegetables stew cooked by Gogo.
