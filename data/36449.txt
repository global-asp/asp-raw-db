page_text:

P1	We were going to our brother's house but first we played.
P2	After that I ate some magic fruits that turned me into my brother!
P3	She ate magic fruits again, but this time she was a chicken!
P4	When she saw something she wanted to run. "Hey man,"  said Yinger. "There's something that wants to eat me."
P5	"Oh no." said Chickly. "Let's go and tell the dog!"
P6	"Let's tell the horse!" said Doggly "He might know what to do!"
P7	They telled the donkey and he went to go to talk with the cow.
P8	When Yinger went home her father tried to eat a peach on a tree.
P9	When her father ate the peach nothing happened.
P10	Suddenly he was sick.
P11	So she saved him and told her father she ate magic fruits. "You transform to things?!" shouted her dad. "I will not eat magic fruits ever again." replied Yinger.
