desc:	Banana and Toffee are friends who like eating very different types of foods. When their school has a race

page_text:

P1	Banana and Toffee have been best friends since they were very young. They always play together after school at each other's houses.
P2	For breakfast Toffee normally has doughnuts. And lunch and dinner is usually filled to the brim with pizza and sweets. Toffee's mom tries to get him to eat more fruits and vegetables, but the only fruit Toffee will eat is Toffee Apples.
P3	Banana helps his mom to take care of his mom's vegetable garden by fertilizing and watering the plants in the soil.  Banana goes to his mom's vegetable garden every morning and handpicks out some leafy greens for a salad, and fruits for lunch. Banana is fit and strong and very active.
P4	The morning of the race, Banana and Toffee were sitting together eating their snacks. Banana asked Toffee, "What do you have in your lunch box?" Toffee answered, "I'm eating a big, sweet, stuffed doughnut! What are you eating?" he asked Banana. @Banana replied, "I'm eating the carrots and tomatoes from my mom's vegetable garden. Would you like some?'"@Toffee shook his head and said, "No, thank you!"
P5	As the morning progressed the day started to get hotter and hotter. Banana drank lots of water to stay hydrated, and Toffee drank his usual Cola.
P6	It was soon time for the race to commence. While they were waiting to start, Toffee was hopping up and down where he sat, bursting with energy from the sweets that he had eaten earlier.
P7	Banana and Toffee took their places behind the starting line.@@The teacher yelled, "Ready, Set, GO!"
P8	'AND THEY WERE OFF!' @@Toffee sped ahead of Banana filled with the energy that his sweets had given him.
P9	Run - Run - Run
P10	When they reached the third lap, Toffee was starting to slow down, the burst of energy that he had leaving him. He clutched his stomach and groaned, "I'm not feeling too well… my tummy hurts."@@Banana slowly caught up with his friend and overtook him.
P11	'AND BANANA WINS BY FAR!'
P12	While Banana was very happy to have won the race, he felt bad for his friend who was still struggling. He grabbed his water bottle and went over to Toffee. Toffee drank some of the water and with his friend by his side, was able to finish the race.
P13	Toffee realised that he can't rely on sugary things to give him enough energy to last the whole day. By eating sweets instead of fruits or vegetables, he was releasing all of the energy at once. He needs to adapt a healthy and balanced lifestyle and stop eating so many toffee apples!
