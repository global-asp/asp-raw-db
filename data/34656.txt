page_text:

P1	Amara was walking through the park. @@The trees in the park were green and healthy. @@But, there was one tree that was brown and dry.
P2	"This tree needs water," said Amara to herself.@@She watered the tree and it came to life with new growth.@@It was a magnificent green tree.
P3	Then, the tree spoke! @@"You watered me and brought me back to life," said the tree.@@"I'm a magic tree, I shall grant you three wishes."
P4	Amara made her first wish.@@"I wish for a red bicycle," she said cautiously.@@Abracadabra! A red bicycle appeared.
P5	She made her second wish after thinking for a few moments.@@"I wish for a radio," said Amara. @@Abracadabra! A radio appeared.
P6	Amara made her third wish.@@"I wish for pink crystal earrings," she said happily.@@Abracadabra! Pink crystal earrings appeared.
P7	The magic tree said, "You have everything that you wanted."@@Amara smiled, "Yes I do, but those things were not for me." @@The magic tree looked confused.
P8	"The bicycle is for my older brother. He outgrew his bicycle. The radio is for Dad. His radio broke. The earrings are for Mum. She loves fancy earrings," explained Amara.@@"And they will all share with me!" she added.
