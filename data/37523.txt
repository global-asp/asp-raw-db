page_text:

P1	I have a cat named Mr. Grey. @He’s full of mischief and loves to play.@I wonder what he’ll get up to today?
P2	Oh no! Mr. Grey knocked over some paint! @Quick, call the pet parlour, do. @For Mr. Grey’s grey coat is now very blue.
P3	The pet parlour came to fetch Mr. Grey @to give him a bath and a pamper day.
P4	Mr. Grey refused to bath. @He escaped through the window @and ran down the path.
P5	Mr. Grey arrived back home, looking very blue! @I guess I’ll have to bath you myself. @What else can I do?
P6	I’ll run a bath with lots of bubbles, @lie back and soak away your troubles.
P7	Mr. Grey resisted at first.@But then he discovered @that the bubbles could burst!
P8	He splashed and played until not a bubble remained! @And he was no longer blue, but grey once again!
