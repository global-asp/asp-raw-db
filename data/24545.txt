page_text:

P1	Nelly is 10 years old while Vivian is 4 years old. they seem to be best friends but they are always fighting all the time. this makes my mother so very angry
P2	When Vivian was born, she was so small and when Nelly went to see her in the hospital she said, "My sister's head is as small as my palm." she then made sure she would tease this small thing that had taken her place as a last born.
P3	Litttle Vivian while growing just kept smiling i guess she knew she actually be the one teasing. that is why they always fought.
P4	Vivian likes dancing while Nelly likes poetry and they ensure that the whole household gets their attention when doing what they like. But Nelly was very lazy
P5	She would look on when Vivian did work and yet she liked to eat very much
P6	they go t the same school and Nelly defends Vivian when she has trouble because she is her big sis
P7	They even play together and make the same friends who call them twins because of their annoying ways. though they are still kind.
P8	When they grow up they want to be rich and help their parents and me of course because am their inspiration.
P9	They may be annoying, stubborn and impossible to deal with them but they are amazing and am glad i have them am glad am a big sister and am glad am a big sister to Nelly and Vivian.
