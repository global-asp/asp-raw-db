page_text:

P1	The rat king was very proud. "The rats are the most wonderful animals in the world," he said. All the other rats agreed with him. "You're right," they all said. "We are the most wonderful animals in the world."
P2	"I'm the most wonderful king in the world," said the rat king. "It's true! You are the most wonderful king in the world," shouted all the other rats.
P3	"My son is the most wonderful prince in the world," said the rat king. "We agree! Your son is the most wonderful prince in the world," agreed all the other rats.
P4	"We must find a wife for my son," the rat king said to his elders. "No other animal is as wonderful as the rat. My son must marry the best girl in the world. Where can we find her?"
P5	The elders thought for a long time. Then one of them said,  "There is one person who is greater than us." "Who is that?" asked the rat king. "Our Creator," the elder said. "You're right," the rat king said. "Our Creator is greater than us. Go and ask our Creator for his daughter."
P6	The elders of the rats went up to the sky to see their Creator. "Please," they said. "Our prince,  the son of the rat king,  is the most wonderful animal in the world. Will you give us your daughter to be his wife?"
P7	The Creator smiled. "If your prince is really the most wonderful animal in the world,  then he's too good for my daughter. He must marry someone greater than her," said the Creator. "Who?" asked the rats. "Fog is greater than me," said the Creator. "Fog comes into the sky and covers me. I can't escape from him. I can't send him away. Ask the fog for his daughter."
P8	The elders went back to their king. "The Creator is always right," the rat king said. "The fog is greater. Go and ask the fog for his daughter."
P9	So the elders went to find Fog. They said,  "Our prince is the greatest animal in the world,  and he wants to marry your daughter." "Tell me about him," said Fog. "He's clever and handsome," the elder began. "Stop!" said the fog. "He's too good for my daughter. He must marry someone greater than me."
P10	"Who is greater than the fog?" the elders asked. "Wind is greater than me," said the fog. "She blows me away. I can't stand against the wind. Ask Wind for her daughter."
P11	The elders went back to the rat king. "Fog is right," said the rat king. "Wind is greater than him. Go and ask Wind for her daughter."
P12	The elders went to find the wind. "Great Wind," they said. "We come from the rat king. He is the greatest king in the world and he wants your daughter to marry his son." "Is he really the greatest king in the world?" asked Wind. "He's too good for me. Your prince must find someone greater," she said.
P13	"Who is greater than the wind?" the elders asked. "Mountain is greater than me," answered Wind. "I push against him and blow on him,  but he never moves. Go and ask Mountain for his daughter." The elders went back to their king. "Yes!" he cried. "Wind is right. Go and speak to the mountain."
P14	So the elders went and spoke to the mountain. "Is your prince really so great and wonderful?" asked Mountain. "He is too good for my daughter. He must marry someone better than her." "Who? Who?" asked the elders. "The bush rat is greater than me," the mountain said. "He makes holes inside me and I can't stop him."
P15	The elders went back to their king. The rat king said,  "The bush rat is my cousin! His daughter will be a very good wife for my son."
P16	So the rat prince married the bush rat's daughter. They lived happily for many years.
