page_text:

P1	The bus stop in my village was full of people.
P2	The bus conductor shouted, “Going to the city!
Leaving now!”
P3	People kept their bags. 

Others pushed to get on the bus.
P4	Women with children sat down. 

The journey would be long.
P5	I sat near the window next to a man.
P6	I thought, “I am going to the big city! I will miss my village.”
P7	There were many hawkers selling their goods.
P8	Some passengers bought things. 

I had no money to buy anything.
P9	Suddenly, the driver blew the horn. 

It was time to leave.
P10	The hawkers pushed each other to go out of the bus.
P11	“Will I ever return to my village again?" I asked myself.
P12	On the way, it became very hot. 

I closed my eyes.
P13	I thought about my mother, my brother, my rabbits and my tree seedlings.
P14	I repeated the name of the place where my
uncle lived in the city.
P15	Many hours later, I was woken up. 

Almost everyone had left.
P16	It was time to look for my uncle’s house.
