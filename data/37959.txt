P1	During christmas the weather is chilly. Warm fine cookies made by Mrs. Lily. The cinnamon smell in the air. I drink my hot chocolate in my rocking chair. I stay up way past my bedtime. Santa's close can't you hear his bells chime. Goodnight
P2	In the deep river wakes Wayde.@He pops out the water looking for shade.@He walks on the river with his icy paws. @Frostwalk and freeze the river for Santa Claus.@He flicks his tail to clean his way.@He rests in the last river night Wayde.
P3	Drop everything and pause. It's the one and only Santa Claus. Getting ready for flight with his big thick sack. Hanging with all the presents upon his back. He sinks into the night with all his deer. The elves watch him with a single tear.
P4	Hot chocolate warm and tasty all the way to the top. Don't you  or dare let it drop! The marshmallows float in your cup. Some don't like marshmallows like Mr.Krupp. Sit down have a drink with a marshmallow.  Hot chocolate is it you know.
P5	Start from the trunk of all the pine trees. We all want a large one don't you see. Real or fake we don't care! Just get it in the room dont let a leaf tear! The round ornaments on each branch. Will they fall not a chance! Top it with a star
