P1	Dog and Jackal were Sekamana's workers.

They hunted for him during the day.
P2	They guarded his compound at night.
P3	Each evening, Sekamana ate good meat for dinner.

But he gave only bones to Dog and Jackal.
P4	One day, Jackal said to Dog, “We must rebel against Sekamana’s bad treatment. Run away with me!”
P5	But out of respect and fear, Dog decided to stay. 

Jackal ran away.
P6	Soon, Sekamana noticed that Jackal was gone. "Where is my brave hunter?" he asked Dog. 

Dog told him the whole story.
P7	Since then Jackal has not returned.

He hunts by himself and eats the meat he has hunted.
