page_text:

P1	Once Ants were men and made their living by tilling the soil, Buut they were never content. They were always casting longing eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours. They used to steal the crops when- ever they got the chance,
P2	and added to their own store. One day their greediness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into Ants. But, their nature remained the same although their forms were changed. Till date they go about the comfields and gather fruits of
P3	others labour, and store them up for their own use. @      Moral: The habits never change.
