page_text:

P1	On the 23rd of April 2014 started my journey, I arrived at Talisay City Cebu a home for the poorest of the poor youth of the country who wished to continue their aspiration in life
P2	We are raised spiritually by teaching the word of God and instilling that we should live with virtues of charity, chastity, gratitude and joy.
P3	And we are also taught to be diligent and do not waste our time. We have schedule for the time we wake up until the time we go to our beds.
P4	As I graduated on the 11th day of September 2019 I am very blessed and proud that I  am one of the Fr. Al's Miracle
