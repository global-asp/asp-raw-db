page_text:

P1	There existed a monstrous animal called Lingiri. It lived in a cave at the foot of a mountain.
P2	Lingiri swallowed all the people on earth. Except one pregnant woman.
P3	This expectant mother lived alone near a forest. She would go to collect firewood to cook her food.
P4	One time when she went to collect firewood,  she collected a heap that was too heavy for her to carry. She said to herself aloud,  "Who will help me raise this firewood on to my head?"
P5	It so happened that the day for this mother to deliver was due. When she was struggling to lift the firewood,  the child jumped out and said,  "Mother,  let me lift for you." Since the child still had the umbilical cord,  she named him Otukolia. His name meant 'one with a long uncut umbilical cord.'.
P6	When Otukolia had grown up a bit,  he asked his mother,  "Eyaa,  I see only you and me,  where are the other people?" His mother replied,  "Grow up a bit more."
P7	Each time Otukolia pestered his mother to tell him where their relatives were. But his mother would always reply,  "Grow up a bit more."
P8	When his mother saw that the boy had grown up and was able to defend himself,  she told him about the monstrous animal. "This monster has swallowed everyone. It lives in a cave at the foot of the mountain. The people are still alive in the monster!" said the woman.
P9	When he was about seventeen,  Otukolia started making many sharp razor blades. When he was fully prepared,  he climbed up the mountain and sat on a stone and started calling Lingiri in a loud voice,  "Li--ngi-ri-ri-ri,  Li-ng-i-ri-i-i-i."
P10	When Lingiri heard the call,  he responded "Yiyiyiyiyi -yi-yi-yi-yi," and his voice shook the earth. He asked,  "I've eaten all the Bari. I've eaten all the Ndrua. I've eaten all the Ma'di. Who is calling me up there?"  Otukolia called again and Lingiri responded asking the same question,  "Who is calling me up there?"
P11	Lingiri walked out of his cave. His long tongue stretched out towards Otukolia,  ready to eat him.
P12	Lingiri attempted to lick up Otukolia with his tongue. But each time,  Otukolia cut Lingiri's tongue with the sharp razor blades.
P13	Lingiri's tongue got smaller and weaker until the monster died. Otukolia took a machete and cut open the monster's tummy.
P14	All the people in Lingiri's tummy came out with great joy. They thanked him for liberating them. Otukolia became their king for defeating Lingiri.
