page_text:

P1	My cousin Thando got married last year to a nice gentleman by the name of Thuto.
P2	The lobola negotiations went well and lobola was . Everything went well, except one thing!
P3	After lobola negotiations they planned to have the weeding ceremony in town. My self and my family on our way to the Metromonial venue to be held in the church in town, we passed a car that had broken down!
P4	Two people were under the bonnet of the car, trying to fix it. We did not stop to help them because we were in hurry to attend the weeding ceremony!
P5	We arrived at the church just as the "bride" arrived. She looked beautiful with her lovely white dress. To our surprise, all the guests looked worried because Thuto, the "groom" had not yet arrived!@@The bride waited with her father!
P6	She could not enter the church until the groom arrives. "Maybe Thuto was at the side of the road trying to fix the broken car"?, I thought.
P7	I whispered this thought to my father, my father quickly decided that we drive back to the broken car we saw on the road. On our way back we found Thuto and his father walking tiredly along the road, after failing to fix the car.
P8	Upon recognizing Thuto and his father, wearing designer suits my father called them to jump into the car and rush to the church.@@Upon arrival , the couple made their vows and the church was filled with wonic and singing as well allulation.
P9	Afterwards there was a reception at the hotel. It went till late into the night. With delicious food and lots of dancing.
P10	All the guests chanted at the newly married couple and said:@           "Speech, speech, speech"@Thuto made a speech to everyone attended. He also made a special thanks to myself and father for rescuing him on the day.
P11	Afterwards the celebrations continued as traditional ceremony in the village.
