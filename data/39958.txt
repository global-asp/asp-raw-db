desc:	While traveling to Nairobi the car suddenly runs out of fuel

page_text:

P1	We were on our way to Nairobi when our car ran out of fuel. @@We walked to the petrol station two kilometres away and my father bought the fuel.
P2	On our way back we saw a park. @@The park had a telephone booth, a bench and some trees.
P3	We asked father to let us to go to the park. He gave us money for buying entry tickets. @@We were amazed to see all the swings in the play ground.
P4	We played like we had never before since it was not a planned day. @@We played as much as we could possibly play.
P5	Father waited for us on the bench that was next to the telephone booth. @@The telephone booth was next to the tree and the tree was next to the play ground.
P6	We played for hours and hours and finally we got tired and walked out of the park. @@We walked back to our car.
P7	We got into our car and gave that day a thumbs up. @@We knew that unplanned visits were the best.
