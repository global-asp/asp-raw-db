page_text:

P1	I am the sun. I bring warmth and light. Everybody loves me. Boys and girls enjoy to swim. Girls enjoy to wear their colourful sun dresses.  Boys have fun in their  shorts and caps.
P2	I am the wind. I can be nasty if I want. I blow the papers all around.  I throw the tree leaves onto the ground.I keep the children in doors. I can be dusty too.
P3	I am the rain. Children love me. They like to jump up and down and sing in the rain. Plants grow. Rain water fills up dams and rivers. Frogs sing in jubilation.
P4	I am the snow. I bring cold conditions. Nobody likes me. I cover the ground with a white coat. Children put on warm clothes and keep indoors.
P5	I am the thunder. I strike with fire. I can kill people and animals.  I keep everyone away from the trees. Do not use water when it rains with thunder.
P6	I am the clouds. I can move slowly or fast. I cover the sun light. I can be very dark or lighter.  Sometimes I bring cold conditions. Children put on warm clothes.
