P1	The day that we've been talking about has come. We are going to play soccer. Chiefs versus Aces. Come and watch! Come with your vuvuzela!
P2	Wonderful Chiefs,  the cup must come to sleep at home. I want us to work together as a team in order to defeat Aces. We must attack wisely,  be careful,  and pass to each other.
P3	Pass the ball,  pass it,  Portia,  Modise! Defend,  defend,  Jomo! There it is,  there it is,  let it go to the goals!
P4	You played wonderfully,  my beautiful Chiefs! You attacked wisely,  you were careful,  and you shared the ball. You played as a real team!
P5	'High Five! Give yourselves a hand!' says the coach.
P6	Oh! We are tired,  but it was good to prepare ourselves. When is the match,  Coach?
P7	The day came that we were waiting for. The coach brought us the kit. Halala Chiefs,  halala! It's going to be a good game. The cup is ours!
P8	Our kit is so beautiful! Thank you,  coach! You are a wonderful coach!
