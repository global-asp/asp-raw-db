desc:	Tells about the origin of coffee in Ethiopia.

page_text:

P1	Coffee is a plant which produces berries with seeds inside. The seeds are coffee beans.

There are many legends about the discovery of coffee. One of them is the legend of Kaldi in Ethiopia.
P2	Kaldi was a young Ethiopian shepherd.

One day Kaldi's goats ate red berries off the coffee plant and he noticed that they started jumping around.
P3	Kaldi was eager to know whether the berries gave the goats energy. He chewed the fruit. The taste was extremely bitter!
P4	After a while, Kaldi felt alert and full of energy.
P5	He picked some of the coffee leaves and fruit, and took them home.

He offered the fruit to his wife.
P6	His wife chewed the berries and felt the same effects that Kaldi had felt.

Kaldi and his wife thought that it was a gift from God.
P7	Days later, Kaldi took some of the coffee leaves and fruit to a nearby monastery. 

Kaldi told the whole story about the goats and the berries to the monks.
P8	When he left the monastery, two monks secretly followed Kaldi. They wanted to check whether what he had told them was true.

The monks saw that it was true. The goats ate the berries and were in a playful mood.
P9	The monks returned to the monastery. They told the other monks to boil the coffee fruit. 

The monks drank the boiled fruit and found it tasted terribly bitter! They thought that it was a devil's drink.
P10	They threw the remains of the fruit onto a fire. Suddenly, they could smell a nice aroma coming from the fire.

A noble idea of roasting, then boiling the seeds came to their minds.
P11	The beverage brewed from the roasted coffee beans tasted much better than before. 

After the monks had drunk the beverage they felt alert and energetic.
P12	Since then, people have drunk brewed coffee to stay awake, and also for enjoyment.

Coffee drinking started in Ethiopia and spread across the world!
