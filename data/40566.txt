page_text:

P1	One day the animals were going out. A few hours later, there was a massive storm with loads of rain.
P2	The animals were in danger because there was no one around to save them. They waited a couple of minutes. Then the flood started the gane up, and all rushed around the farmyard.
P3	A few moments later all the animals came rushing out of the farmyard. Because the flood was rising and rising and the current was getting stronger.
P4	Suddenly, all the water was flowing  out rising and rising and the animals starting to drown saying, help us help us.
P5	10 minutes later the water was as high as it could go and finally the farm people came round and saved them all, and at last dry and wormth.
