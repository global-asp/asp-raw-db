page_text:

P1	 Long, long time ago, the Hyena had a brown coat without dots. That time, he lived with his great friend Hare whom they their friendship had grew so abundantly. The two friends had a great herd of animals and a vast fields of maize, barley and sorghum.
P2	The two friends took turns on their daily duties. If Hare goes to look after the cattle, Hyena could work in the farm. At times, they could go both of them to graze in the plains when there was little to be done in the farm.
P3	When thee fields were brown and the produce ready for harvest, the two friends worked tirelessly in the fields. They used to rise up early in the morning and worked in the fields till dusk. They harvested huge sacks of maize barley and sorghum in which they exchanged for animals hence got richer and richer.
P4	Time faded by and the friends felt the need to marry since they were getting older and they needed someone who could take care of  their vast wealth and even themselves when they get old. After a thorough consultation, the two friends got a wave about a village which was far away. The village was said to have beautiful girls.
P5	The two friends began their preparations. Hare baked sorghum breads and also packed roasted corn. On the other hand, Hyena slaughtered a very fat calf and smoked the meat. They had enough food to sustain them in their three day journey and off they set.
P6	After three day of journeying through thick forests, across valleys, ridges and plains, Hare and Hyena set their feet on the intended village. They arrived at dusk on the third day and were welcomed with a dance. Beautiful ladies danced around the fire place where huge logs were glowing red with ambers of fire.
P7	Hyena could not help salivating from the nose piercing smell of roasted meat from the kitchen. According to the customs of the villagers, the bride was supposed to select a suitor  of her own choice. The two friends were ushered to the visitor's room where they were served with beer to clear dust off their throats.
P8	They were then served with hot sweet potatoes. They both ate to their fill. Hare saw that he had so many potato peels on his side. Hare feared that the bride will hate him for huge appetite, so he waited for the best time to set his friend. Luck smiled at hare because not long hyena went out to relieve himself. Hare pushed a lot of potato peels to hyena's side then relaxed.
P9	The bride then arrived in the company of her mother and her several aunts. She was actually a beauty. Bangles made noise  on her legs as she walked. Her navel had also a ring and beautiful neck creases. To everyones' surprise, she chose hyena. She said, "Since he eats a lot, he will work hard to feed his family and himself."
P10	After a short ceremony, the two friends went back to their village, hyena with a wife, hare a bachelor. Hare used to weep all night long  and begrudged his friend though he did not  show it openly. He planned to kill his friend then inherit his wife because according to their customs wife inheritance was allowed.
P11	Hare knew that hyena had a habbit of going to bath during the night at the nearby stream. Hare took a sack and hid near the  stream. Hyena came as usual dipped into the water. Hare waited  and as hyena got out of the water, hare sprang and slipped the sack on hyena. Hyena cried in vain, he was beaten thoroughly and then the sack put on fire.
P12	Hare ran  back home thinking that he had killed his friend. After one day, hyena appeared with dotted skin and a limping. He had been told by tortoise who had witnessed hare beat his friend. Hyena decided to kill hare. By good luck hare managed to escape, never to return.
P13	From that day on, there is no more friendship between the hare and the hyena and hyena got dotted skin for being burned and limps while walking.****The End*****.
