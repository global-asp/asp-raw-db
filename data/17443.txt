page_text:

P1	A long time ago,  the king of the bush was Mr Lion.
P2	He sent his animals to stop the noise coming from a small lake in the bush. But they did not succeed!
P3	An elephant volunteered to stop it. The elephant was sent out as a guard.
P4	At midnight the noise began and the elephant started killing the frogs. He did the same thing the next day.
P5	After a couple of weeks,  King Lion was happy because the elephant had stopped the noise.
P6	But about a month later,  they saw a lot of insects on their farm.
P7	King Lion asked the elephant to call the frogs to come and eat the insects.
P8	The elephant was very nervous because he had killed all of them. He said,  "Sorry,  sorry,  I k- k- k- killed them!"
P9	Then King Lion said: Elephant,  I asked you to stop the noise,  not to kill the frogs. And the elephant was put in prison for many years!
P10	And the king told all the animals to always do exactly what he said.
