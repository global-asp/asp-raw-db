page_text:

P1	One day the King of the Forest decided that it was time for him to find the next King. He held a meeting with all the animals of the Forest.@@The King told the animals that he wanted to find a new King for them. He said, "But the new King will have to win a competition."
P2	He explained, "Those who are interested, will throw my magical spear. The spear must hit the ground and stand on its sharp point. The first animal to do that will be the next King of the Forest."
P3	All the animals agreed and were very excited.@@Elephant threw the spear first. The magical spear failed to hit the ground and stand on its sharp point. @@Elephant was very angry.
P4	Wild Pig was the second to try.@@He also failed and walked away very angry.
P5	Then came Baboon. He threw the magical spear. @@He too failed. The magical spear flew in the sky and fell flat on the ground.
P6	As the competition drew to an end, Deer shouted, "It is my turn!" All animals looked at him with disbelief and laughed.@@Deer ignored them and took the magical spear. With all his strength, Deer threw the magical spear.@@The magical spear made a curve and landed in the ground on its sharp point.
P7	All the animals were surprised at Deer. They could not believe that Deer would be the new King of the Forest.@@Deer danced around celebrating his victory.
P8	A ceremony was organised and everybody celebrated.@@And so Deer became the new King of the Forest.
