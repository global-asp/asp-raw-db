P1	Ebimera biri n'emisi, amahose ko n'ebimuli. Ebimera biƞwa mu bumo. Plants have roots, leaves and flowers New plants grow from seeds.
P2	Ebimera ebindi biri n'obumo obugwa hwiroba hupi n'ehimera. Hiino higima ehimera ehinyaha hya mera hupi n'ehihayire. Some plants have seeds that fall on the ground around the plants. This makes new plants to grow well tῃo the old.
P3	Ebimera ni bihula biiti byebungiha hyabiretera ohutafuna butangafu w'eryuba obuhena. Ebindi bihunduga olusi byafa. Ebiƞona bikukumusa obumo wabyo ehiƞwamo nga bimera eyo eyi bumo buba ni buguuye. When plants grow this way,  they are crowded and might not get quite enough sunshine, some shrivel and die but most plants spread their seeds around. These seeds sprout in new places.
P4	Ebimera ebindi bisenguha n'obumo wa byo. Some plants travel with their seeds. The wind blows then around and they move while dropping off their seeds.
P5	Bbo-o-pu-u! Ebimera ebindi biba n'obumo bungi bugali,  ni buƞangala bwoma nga bwadiha. Otumo tuno tusambuha twaƞwanyuha. Bop! Some plants get full of seeds and dry up and break open. The tiny seeds Bop out.
P6	Ebimera ebindi bihulira hunjabi hupi n'amaaji. Obumo bugwa mu maji nga buseyeya hu maaji ago. Hu komerero bwola mwiroba nga bumerera eyo. Other plants grow near water,  their seeds drop into the water and float away. At the end of the journey,  they settle into the soil and germinate.
P7	Obumo obundi weƞamba hu solo ja bugesya wa tiina ni bukukumuha ng'olu solo eba n'egendire. Stickers on some seeds help them to travel far,  these seeds wait for an animal to walk by and then they stick into us fur.
P8	Enyuni jigesya obumo ohwola mu bifo ebinyaha. Jirya ebibala nga jija jinia amasyologoho gaajo aƞale eyo eyi jigendera. Obumo buhena bwamera eyo eyi swagwa. Birds carry some plant seeds to new places too.
P9	Epunga, amaaji n'ebisolo biyeeda obumo. Obumo buno buhoma ƞaale. These seeds germinate into plants and spread new seeds to new places.
P10	Obumo si bugenda oba ohuduluma aye bufuluha. Seeds cannot walk or run but they can travel!
