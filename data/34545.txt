desc:	When people go on the water in a small boat with an engine

page_text:

P1	John has a new boat with a very powerful engine. @@"Come on, Denver!" he says to his friend. "I'll take you for a ride!"
P2	Just as John turns up the speed, a big wave rises out of nowhere. The boat is flung high into the air! @@"Agh!" yells a terrified Denver, as they are thrown into the sea.
P3	While treading water, John looks up and sees that the boat is still moving fast. @@And it's coming straight towards him!
P4	John can't get out of the way quickly enough, and the boat hits him!@@John is not wearing a lifejacket. His cries for help come out as bubbles as he sinks under the water.
P5	"John! John!" Denver screams as he swims as fast as he can to help his friend.@@"You're hurt!" says Denver, as he reaches John's limp body floating on the surface.
P6	Denver grabs hold of John and waves his arm, hoping someone will see them. @@Luckily, a Sea Rescue boat is on patrol close by, and the crew races over and helps the men out of the water. @@They radio for a helicopter to take John to hospital.
P7	When the rescue helicopter arrives, John is flown to hospital. @@"You're very lucky to be alive," says the doctor after examining John's injuries.
P8	Once they know that John is alright, the Sea Rescue crew return to their boat. They head back out to sea to carry on with their patrol.
P9	"This is what John should have done," says the Sea Rescue skipper to the crew. He points to his lifejacket and the 'kill switch' tied to his arm. @@"A 'kill switch' would have stopped the boat's engine and none of this would have happened," said the skipper.
