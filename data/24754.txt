desc:	Salemkaan experiences the power of the wind.

page_text:

P1	Salemka'an ran out with her kite to play when the wind howled like a wolf.
P2	The wind played with her hair and dress but grew stronger and so she lost her kite.
P3	As the wind blew stronger, she ran to get the clothes from the line.
P4	The wind was faster than her. It swirled and churned.

It carried her kite, clothes, house and even the trees and leaves.
P5	The wind churned and weaved them all together into a vortex.
P6	Then the wind began to calm, it dropped some trees. 
Salemka'an's kite was stuck to a branch.
P7	The wind tossed her kite and some leaves around.
P8	She twirled and twirled as the wind dropped her from the sky along with a tree.
P9	She held on to the roots because she felt woozy, woozy.
P10	She staggered up still holding on to the roots, looking around for everything the wind weaved into a vortex.
P11	She saw her house, a few leaves and tree trunks. 

She didn't see her kite but walked home all the same.
P12	Salemka'an knew that the wind would blow again and so she will see her kite again.
