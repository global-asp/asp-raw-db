page_text:

P1	There was an ant invasion in our house.
P2	It was raining and a windy evening.
P3	Daddy and Ben my kid brother have just went out to town.
P4	I wanted to follow them, but unlike Ben, I had homework to attend to.
P5	The ants came crashing through the window and every opening in the house.
P6	They went straight for the light bulbs and the television sets.
P7	It was as if we were under attack.
P8	My mother did not seem to be bothered or afraid of the flying ants.
P9	My sister Labigah laughed at me as I tried to hide under the bed
P10	As I crunched under the bed, suddenly there was a sharp pain on my toe.
P11	I came out of my hiding place and charged at the ants with a broom.
P12	It was an adventurous evening and I could not wait for Daddy to come home.
P13	I want to tell him about the invasion and tell him the ant bite! on my toe!
