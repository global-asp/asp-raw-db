desc:	Now you know why goats refuse to be pulled!

page_text:

P1	Goat was king of animals and birds. 

He called a meeting.
P2	Goat told them that he had a dream. 

They all listened.
P3	The dream was about hunger. 

“What shall we do?” asked Cat.
P4	Hen and Duck said, “Let’s keep food in the king’s store.”
P5	King Goat said, “Tie up anyone who does not obey.”
P6	It was time to choose a new king. 

They chose Cat.
P7	Goat did not want Cat as king. “I am the king.”
P8	Goat did not take food. 

Cow asked, “What shall we do?”
P9	The animals and birds talked together. 

They were angry with Goat.
P10	Dog said, “I was always with him when he was king.”
P11	Sheep said, “I gave his children my beautiful wool.”
P12	Pig cried, “When he was king, I looked after his garden.”
P13	“Did Goat think he will be king forever?” Sheep
  asked.
P14	The animals agreed that Goat must take food to king Cat.
P15	The animals found Goat. Goat said, “I will always be king.”
P16	“We will tie you and take you to the new king.”
P17	Cow pulled Goat to the king’s court. 

Others cheered.
P18	That’s why goats refuse to move when they are pulled.
