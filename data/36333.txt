desc:	Why Mapula did not come to school because her home burned

page_text:

P1	Mapula did not come to school today. There was a big fire at her home. Mupula's family uses paraffin for cooking at home. They have a red paraffin stove. Mapula has a young brother, Thami, who never listens to anyone.
P2	Last night Thami played with the stove, even though it is no allowed. He also found the matches that someone had carelessly left lying around.
P3	The little boy lit the stove and then, in his excitement, knocked the stove over onto the carpet. Soon the small room was on fire
P4	Luckily for Thami, Mapula carried him out of  the house. She asked the kind neighbors to phone the fire brigade. They arrived very quickly, and they used their long hoses to put the fire out. Soon the whole house was filled with water and -
P5	-smoke.    The fire was put out before Mapula's angry parents came home. Everything in the room was burned, and Mapula was very sad because her favorite baby doll and her beautiful workbooks were also burned in the fire.
P6	Today, Mapula helped her mother to clean their house. She hung all the wet blankets and curtains in the sun to dry. Meanwhile little Thami had been sent to preschool, so that he could stay out of trouble.
P7	Tomorrow Mapula will go back to school. Her mother will buy her a new school bag.@@THE END
