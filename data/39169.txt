page_text:

P1	Some time ago in a town of Achebe, a lady had two daughters (twins). The twins were very identical. Adole and Adelaide were their names.
P2	Adole was the oldest. She was respectful and dependable just at the age of 2. Adelaide was her twin. Adelaide was unlike her sister. She always wanted a reason to be loved and pampered all the time.
P3	Adelaide was a little selfish and mostly jealous when she saw Mother give Adole tight hugs and kisses when ever she got good grades.
P4	Adelaide would always tell Adole she isn't that beautiful than her and would say hurtful things about her regretting for ever having such a selfish sister.
P5	Mother would always calm Adole down and advice Adelaide to stop meddling in Adole's life.
P6	Adelaide would rush out to the bank of the river and she'd all tears she could ever cry from her eyes. Sometimes, when the river was dry, her tears would rather make up the river. Adelaide then thought of a plan to ruin her sister.
P7	Nana Yaw was a close friend of both Adole and Adelaide but he was much closer to Adole. Adelaide thought Nana Yaw always left her to play with Adole. That made her sad and very angry. One day at school, Adelaide wanted to frame  Adole.
P8	During Adole's science lesson, the teacher called her to search her bag. Shocked faces rose up after an amount of 460,000 Ghana cedis was found in her bag. The class started pointing fingers at her for they thought Adelaide was Adole.
P9	All their classmates thought Adelaide was Adole but Nana Yaw could never believe such. Nana Yaw new from the start it was Adelaide. Nana Yaw was mad at Adelaide and went looking for Adole but was nowhere to be found.
P10	Adole went from home since she thought her parents never thought her those morals so they will be mad at her. She ran off to a very far place.
P11	But Adole was wrong .Her parents loved her no matter how sweet or evil she is. Their parents suffered a huge lost knowing Adole was gone forever. Adelaide had no regret for anything.
P12	One day, when wondering for food, Adole saw a huge tiger running her way. She ran from a high distance. She hid inside the bushes. Suddenly, someone grabbed her by the hand, pulled her and pounced on her.She broke her hand.
P13	An armed robber had pounced on her and took control of her. That 18 year old girl was now pregnant.
P14	In those 9 years of Adole's departure, Adelaide now became a high tech model who studied in the UK for using Adole's meant-to-be scholarship.
P15	Adelaide also tried her best to get close to Nana Yaw after the disappearance of Adole. Nana Yaw was willing to fulfill Adole's promise of getting along with Adelaide before her departure in 9 years.
P16	Nana Yaw decided to get married to Adelaide for the sake of Adole. Adelaide was willing to have kids with Nana Yaw so Nana Yaw would forget about the past.
P17	After 9 good months, Adole gave birth to a bouncing baby boy but the baby was unhealthy since Aole had nothing to feed him and herself.
P18	One day when was on a construction of fruit in the forest, Nana Yaw found his long time friend, Adole. He hugged Adole and found out about the story of 9 years ago. Nana Yaw urshured his rage upon Adely and decided to throw her out.
P19	Adelaide was thrown out of the house. Adelaide grew more hatred for her sister. She planed on killing her sister. She came back to the house and decided to stab Adole. Bravely, Nana Yaw stood in front of Adole and got stabbed instead.
P20	Realizing that she committed a huge mistake, she stabbed herself and killed herself.
P21	Some years later, Adole got married to Nana Yaw.
P22	They both had a daughter after they had gotten married.
