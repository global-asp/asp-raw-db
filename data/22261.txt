page_text:

P1	There lived an old man called Hagos. He lived with his three sons.

Hagos wanted his sons to have wealth after his death. He prepared three boxes for them.
P2	Hagos went to his neighbour Haile and said, "I want my sons to have wealth. I have prepared three boxes. I want you to give them the boxes after I die."
P3	After Hagos died, Haile called the sons together.

He told them, "Your father gave me these boxes before he died. You will each find your name on one of them. Take yours please."
P4	The sons took the boxes and opened them.

The first box had gold in it. The second box had soil. The third box had animal dung in it.
P5	The one who found gold was very happy. The other two were not happy. They started quarrelling with him.
P6	"You are brothers, you should not quarrel. Let me take you to a wise old man to advise you," said Haile to the three brothers.
P7	Haile took the brothers to the wise old man. 

"Good morning, we have come to ask advice about inheritance," said Haile to the old man.
P8	Haile told the wise old man about the three boxes that Hagos had left for his sons.

"Now they are quarrelling because only one received gold," explained Haile.
P9	The wise old man asserted, "Your father had a reason for giving each of you a particular box."
P10	He continued, "The one who received gold, your father wants you to be a merchant. The one who received soil, your father wants you to be a farmer."
P11	"The one who received animal dung, your father wants you to be a cowboy. Your father wanted you each to have his own profession," the old man concluded.
P12	After they listened to the old man's advice the three brothers agreed. They worked in their professions and lived happily.
