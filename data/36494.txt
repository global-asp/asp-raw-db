page_text:

P1	Hi I'm fatima and if you're religion is different it doesn't mean you're not special and it doesn't mean you don't fit in you see in school people treat me differently but I know I am a human and just like them
P2	I am a good person but people don't realize that because they don't even listen to me it's like I'm invisible but I don't let that stop me from being a good person.
P3	I like me but that's not who people want me to be but I don't let that stop me I have two friends who help me so much lily and james.
P4	That's why your religion doesn't mean your not a good person it means your special.
P5	The End
