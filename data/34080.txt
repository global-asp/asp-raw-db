P3	Teacher said, "Our hands have germs on them, but you can't see germs."
P4	"Germs are very tiny. We need a microscope to see them."
P5	Lina looked through the microscope.@@She saw the germs from her hand.
P6	"Viruses and bacteria are types of germs.@@Germs can make us sick."
P7	"Washing hands stops viruses and bacteria from spreading," said Teacher.
