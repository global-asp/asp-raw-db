P1	In a large populated city called Rume there lived an able man called Lima.Lima lived with his mother who was very old and only stayed in bed.He fed her mother and kept her in good condition.Lima had a talent of playing football.
P2	One day he was invited to play for another team.So Lima did everything that he had planned to do at home very fast so as not to miss the game.Later he went to the venue as fast as lighting.
P3	When Lima arrived he found that he was the only one who the team was waiting for.They one by one walked to the pitch.On arrival they wore their team outfits and began the game.Lima started as a bencher.
P4	The coach assured him that he must play so he got patient.The game was very competitive, Lima's team was scored two then broke for half time.When they were back on the pitch Lima was placed as a stricker.
P5	Lima scored four goals and got injured when he was about to score the fifth.He broke his left leg and that was the end of Lima career as a footballer. But they did win the game.Lima was rushed to the hospital and his leg was plastered.
P6	Lima left the hospital to home.He found his old mother lying on the floor motionlessly.Trembling he called out "mum!mum!"but found that her mother had kicked the bucket.Both tragedies were traumatising but Lima's friends encouraged him
