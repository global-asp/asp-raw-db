page_text:

P1	Tsanzo's village is close to Naisi River. Their garden is along the river bank. Every year, their crops get washed away by floods.
P2	One day, Tsanzo's teacher explained a natural way to prevent floods. "Do not cultivate along the river banks but plant trees." The teacher said.
P3	Tsanzo enjoyed the lesson. At home he told his parents. But his parents were not interested. Tsanzo did not give up. He collected seeds that fell under trees.
P4	He collected 100 waterberry seeds, 100 khanya seeds, 120 African Teak seeds. He planted the seeds in plastic bags he picked from around the village. After 3 weeks, the seeds started to germinate.
P5	He continued to water the seedlings. 300 seedlings were ready for transplantation.
P6	With help of friends, they planted 200 seedlings on the first day. On the second day, they planted the remaining 100. They watered the plants every week.
P7	The trees survived the first rainy season. The following year the trees had grown.
P8	No more floods! The trees trapped trash which prevented the water from washing away the gardens.
