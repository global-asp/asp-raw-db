P1	Simba, a small lion cub lives in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. He loves to run around and explore new things.
P2	Simba usually hangs around with his parents. His mother's name is Zola and his father is called Taio. How many lions can you see?
P3	One day Simba hears a strange noise and decides to start looking for it.
P4	After a while, Simba finds where the noise is coming from. He sees two beautiful birds called Chipo and Kya sitting in a tree.
P5	When Chipo sees Simba, he flies away. How many birds are left? Soon afterwards Kya also flies away. With both the birds gone, Simba carries on walking.
P6	While watching the birds as they fly away, Simba's attention is drawn to something else. He hears something in the bushes and decides to investigate. While Simba carries on walking he notices that he lost his parents.
P7	Simba sees three elephants. The mother elephant named Lesedi has two calves called Adia and Vuyo. Which one is the biggest? Which one is the smallest? The middle one turns around and asks, "Who are you looking for?"
P8	Simba replies, "I am looking for my family!" Lesedi, the mother elephant says, "We do not know where they are and sadly cannot help you." Simba decides to continue looking for his parents. He went too far away from them.
P9	After a long walk he finds eight impala. Three of them get scared because they know lions eat them, so they run away from Simba into the bushes. How many impala are left?
P10	Simba asks the remaining impala, "I am so thirsty from all the walking in the hot sun; do you know where I can find water? The impala, although hesitant, show him a waterhole.
P11	Simba drinks some water and sees another impala drinking from the waterhole. He asks, "Why do you have four ears?"
P12	The impala answers, "I do not have four ears. I have a pair of ears and a pair of horns." Simba has learnt something new today. In the distance he sees a very large creature, so he decides to go and investigate what it is.
P13	When Simba approaches, the large creature sees him and asks, "Why are you sneaking in the grass? I have seen you from miles away." Simba asks nervously,  "What kind of animal are you? "
P14	The animal responds, "I am a giraffe. You can tell because of my height. What do you think, how tall I am?"
P15	After talking to the giraffe, Simba keeps on walking and soon comes across another pride of lions.
P16	Simba approaches the three lions carefully and says, “I have lost my parents. Do you know where they are?” The three lions respond, “Yes, we have seen two lions, but before we say where, you have to solve a riddle."
P17	The riddle goes as following, “We are three lions, but there are two more behind the rock. How many are we?” Simba answers correctly and the lions tell him, “We have seen two lions going down the hill, looking for something."
P18	Following the advice of the lions, Simba runs down the hill and meets several zebras drinking water from a waterhole. Can you count, how many there are?
P19	After a long journey Simba is very tired and needs to rest. While sleeping on a rock he dreams about finally finding his family. Suddenly he wakes up because there is crackling in the bushes. He sees several small animals before him.
P20	The small animals ask Simba, “What are you doing here alone without your parents? We are the attentive meerkats and we followed your paw prints to find you. Are you attentive too? How many of us can you see?"
P21	The meerkats and Simba talked for a while and then say, “We found bigger lion paw prints further down the path. They might be from your parents.” Simba smiles and thanks the meerkats for their help and then followed the paw prints.
P22	Simba cannot believe his eyes. After following the paw prints for several hours he finally finds his parents. After this long journey they are finally reunited.
P23	Simba and his father Taio embrace. Zola and Taio are overjoyed to see Simba again and from now will look after him much better.
P24	Simba tells his parents about his long adventure and what he learnt along the way until he gets tired and his eyes close. How many different types of animals has Simba met during his long adventure?
