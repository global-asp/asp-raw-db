page_text:

P1	A teacher entered a classroom and said to the students. @@"Assume you have 84,000 Ethiopian Birr."
P2	"If a man snatches 10 Birr from you and runs away, would you leave the 86,390 behind and chase after the man?"
P3	"Or would you keep walking with the remaining 86,390 Birr?" the teacher asked. @@The students thought the question was simple.
P4	"We would walk with the remaining money at hand! We would not leave the rest for just 10 Birr," they responded.
P5	Smiling, the teacher said to them, "You see, we miss such points. We have at least 86,400 seconds in a single day."
P6	"In just 10 seconds, a person could insult you and leave. Just because of that insult you encountered in 10 seconds, you spend the entire 86,390 seconds on being angry and annoyed."
P7	"Just as you cannot regain the 10 Birr that the man took away from you, you cannot regain the 10 seconds spend on bad encounter. @@The reason for this is because those 10 seconds could let us lose 86,390 seconds."
P8	"Our today's lesson was about time. This time onwards, save the 86,390 seconds from being wasted uselessly."
