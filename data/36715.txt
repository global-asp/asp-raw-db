page_text:

P1	We get many young readers at Ras Abebe Aregay Library, Debre Birhan. They spend their free time reading books of their choice. @@Before we finish reading, the children play a nice outdoor game. Today, everyone can play and they only need a coin each.
P2	The librarian wants them to play Kisara. This is a childhood game he played two decades ago while shepherding animals. @@Kisara was played by young children who spent their time together in the fields. It was popular among kids who were sharp shooters.
P3	Today, the children use their Abosem lottery to decide the turns to throw the coins. They hide their hands behind their backs. Then they raise the back or front of their hands. @@The one whose hand is held differently from others, takes the first turn. This is repeated until each player has a turn to play.
P4	To play Kisara, there are certain rules. The boy who takes the first turn to throw the coin, wants to cheat. @@He tries to throw after passing the throwing line. The others remind him to stand before the line.
P5	All players throw in their turns. Then they go to the hole to see who was the best thrower. The one who threw straight into the hole, is the first thrower in the next round. @@Then, the boy whose coin was nearest to the hole follows.
P6	Since Solomon's coin entered the hole in the first round, he is the first to collect all the coins. He goes back to throw all of the coins together into the hole. @@We are not done with the game. Wait to know the winners and the losers.
P7	Solomon throws. Two coins go straight into the hole and he takes them. He has a profit of one coin. @@Based on how the others scored in the first throw, each throws all the coins at once. Throwing many coins at once is difficult.
P8	Kirubel is the second scorer in the first round. He throws in this round and collects a coin he was able to throw directly into the hole. @@Kirubel is aware that he is not profiting in this round. He may get more in the coming rounds if he improves his throwing skill.
P9	Kisara in Amharic means, a loss, since there are children who lose. In the past, children played with flat stones and there was no fighting. @@The children in this game borrowed the coins which they will give back.
P10	The chief librarian also practices her shooting skills. She promises to revive this local game.@@"We will play each time you come to read at the library," she tells them.
P11	Now it is time for refreshment and the library treats the children to biscuits and tea. @@The children promise to play more games like Kisara. They will ask their parents and family members to help them discover.
P12	The children come back inside the library to read the African Storybooks they did not finish. @@Those who finished their reading, go home remembering how to play Kisara. They promise to play as many rounds as possible with their friends at home.
