page_text:

P1	Long time ago an elephant and a spirit were in contest. They wanted to know who was mightiest between them.
P2	Each of them believed he was stronger than the other. 

They agreed to meet in the evening for a challenge.
P3	It rained heavily that evening. The weather became extremely cold.
P4	The elephant was asked to stop the rain. The elephant trumpeted, "Auuu Rrrrruuuuu!" 

When nothing happened, the spirit took his turn.
P5	Instead of stopping the rain, the spirit caused loud thunder, which crashed continuously. 

The elephant trembled and fell down with his tusks in the mud.
P6	Then the spirit asked the elephant, "Do you still doubt my power?"

The elephant answered, "I will never doubt you again!"
P7	The elephant said, "I am the greatest among all creatures on earth. I thought I would be greater than you."
P8	Since that contest, the elephant feared the spirit. 

When it rains, elephants hide so that the spirit cannot strike them with thunder.
