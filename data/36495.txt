desc:	Being black is the best thing ever. We are strong

page_text:

P1	Two years ago, My Chinese friend asked why I love being black. I wasn't offended by the question at all and responded of how good the question was for me. The first thing I said to her was I love our history.
P2	And that Sundays were our favourite because we would go to church and sing, dance and cook Sunday dinner after church or before church , we would eat  meals like roasted chicken , peeled potatoes , salads and sit as a family together.
P3	Black people and black skin are beautiful, And when you don't see color that means that you are missing out the gorgeous people around you. You should see their color and love them. We don't see color we see joy in you and kindness .
P4	Our hair is the most wonderful thing ever, even though you may think it's dry and damaged. Our hair can make nice different types of hairstyles and cuts. Black people are creative and good at doing new thing's. We love our natural hair .
P5	Once we learn to love one another, organize with each other. We'll be the most dangerous force in earth.They hate us because they already know who we are but the question is, do we? Do we know who we are ? I don't think we do.
P6	As black people we like saying "I'm Black and proud" But we never tell why. I'd like to correct that. Black people don't just live   life, we experience it.We experience it the way we experience music. Our music is full of joy and love.
P7	We are good at painting, drawing and decorating thing's. I used to watch my grandmother decorating her wooden spoons with beads it looked pretty fun. But hard in the same time. My uncle used to paint he was really good at painting.
P8	Black people are good in fashion. Super good. We can cut our jeans messy and we will look absolutely beautiful in them. Try different types of hairstyles in anyway possible. We could buy a shoe and the next day the shoe will look different.
P9	Honestly I couldn't choose to be anything else, my black it is. Even though we don't have the best relationship among each other. But if we have to fight we fight together and protest together. I have alot to be proud of and less to be not.
