page_text:

P1	Long time ago, Magezi and Kasiira lived by sharing food.
P2	Magezi said, “Let us dig together the way we eat together.”
P3	Magezi told Kasiira, “You dig and I will plant.”
P4	Magezi told Kasiira, “You plant and I will weed.”
P5	When the millet was ripe, Kasiira asked Magezi to harvest it.
P6	Magezi said, “You harvest, I will put it in the granary.”
P7	Magezi was lazy.

So Kasiira gave him only one millet finger.
P8	Magezi took the finger of millet. 
He met Hen.
P9	Hen ate all the millet. 

She gave Magezi an egg.
P10	Magezi met some children. 

They broke the egg.
P11	The children gave Magezi a mango.
P12	Magezi met Parrot.

Parrot ate the mango and gave a feather.
P13	The lake took the feather, and gave Magezi some water.
P14	Magezi used the water to put out the charcoal burners’ fire.
P15	The charcoal burners gave Magezi an axe.
P16	Magezi met some butchers. 

They broke the axe.
P17	Magezi got the bull’s head and tail.

Look what Magezi did!
P18	Then he shouted, “The king’s bull is stuck in the mud!”
P19	People came to help. 
“Pull the tail and head,” said Magezi.
P20	Magezi told the people, “Give me your cattle for the king.”
