page_text:

P1	My friend Nano and I liked to journey into the jungle every day after school. It was our little hiding place where we could just be free. We would climb up the trees and play hide and seek
P2	Climbing up the trees was fun and exciting. I felt invincible but my friend Lucy was not a fan of heights
P3	One day I climbed way too high and I didnt know how I was going to get down. Nano got scared and was begging me to get down but I was stuck
P4	I shouted at the top of my voice to let her know I can't get down, I was scared and i didn't know what to do. Nano told me she was going to get help
P5	Nano called my parents and they came to help me down. They told me to jump and that they would catch me. I did as they said and surely they did catch me.
P6	After I got down, my parents took me home where everyone was glad to see me. I was still a little upset and couldn't stop crying
P7	My parents sat me down and told me to not climb any trees in the jungle as I could hurt myself. They comforted me and told me when I'm older I'll have all the time in the world to explore the jungle properly but for now I'm still too small
P8	Later that evening we had a party with my whole family to celebrate me coming back home safely. We all had fun and enjoyed our food and cake...we also danced till our feet hurt...it was a beautiful evening
