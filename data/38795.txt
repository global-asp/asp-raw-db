P2	Mckenzie's great great @Grandma was a camper@aswell....
P3	Her Grandma's name was Beatriz Kenzie marie, which was a long name.@@@                                        1982@                              January 13
P4	Mckenzie's Great great grandma used to go down the village and search for unique things to go camping once in a lifetime.@Beatriz was a very nice lady in her young age around 35 years old in 1920,@She was quite the adventures person people
P5	used to call her. She was happy with the way she can make people smile with delight.@But that wasn't all, she also used to take care of her people and also would invite them along with her adventures trip!@There was one tragic memory she
P6	can never forget. It was this one day she was going on a trip in the wild east for exploring!@Unexpectedly it did not go well, she was wondering around until she heard BOOM!, BOOM!, and it got even louder, she wasn't expecting anything else
P7	until an olden army came up with no passion, no hesitating, and no kindness, it was just wrong!@Beatriz thought that it would not be a good idea to fight because that is not the way she was raised. Beatriz went home and couldn't explore
P8	more without an army showing up!,@as she got back on her way she told everyone what happend and they all believed her because they knew she was always truthful for anything she says.
P9	Beatriz didn't feel happy and was not feeling well.@She thought her day will just go as fine when it did not.@Even tho she was still impressed at herself for trying.
P10	That was Beatriz's Story,@But moving on we are talking about Mckenzie.@Mckenzie has always admired her great great grandma for who she was, Mckenzie thought she could be just like her but instead these kids from her village school would
P11	make fun of her for who she wanted to be.@Mckenzie did not find it funny, that's why she decided to go up to them and confront them.@Mckenzie thought for a second... saying "should I do it or should I not", she remebered what her great
P12	great grandma did when she didn't want to fight,@so Mckenzie let it go.@Mckenzie's mom has always taught her that she does not need to act like Beatriz all the time and that she has to be herself at most times.@Mckenzie still didn't care
P13	She still wanted to be like Beatriz, she just loved her as much as she loves the world and what exciting things can happen in just a day or two.
P14	That's why Mckenzie decided to change things around her village.@That is when she created her own first camping gear at age 13, 1990, March 18.@She knew and thought people would adore and admire such type of gear.@Instead no one adored it.
P15	Thank you for Reading!@Written by: Mmerichi Ogbonnia-Okoye@Story Book 2
