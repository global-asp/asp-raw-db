page_text:

P1	At home, we have an old sofa. It is red and blue, with yellow and pink cushions. It once belonged to my granny.
P2	My brother loves jumping on the old sofa. My mum doesn't like it when we jump on the old sofa. So, I always try my best to stop him.
P3	One day my mother caught my brother jumping on the old sofa. He was in deep trouble.
P4	My mom grounded my brother and told him that he would not be allowed to touch the television for the next few weeks. I was very happy because it meant I was in charge of the remote control during those few weeks at the beginning of LCKDOWN!
