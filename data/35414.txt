page_text:

P1	Mother, Father and Laraba are talking about how to stay healthy.
P2	Laraba asked at school, "Why must we wash our hands?"
P3	Teacher said, "Our hands have germs on them, but you can't see germs."
P4	"Germs are very tiny. We need a microscope to see them."
P5	Laraba looked through the microscope.@@She saw the germs from her hand.
P6	"Viruses and bacteria are types of germs.@@Germs can make us sick."
P7	"Washing hands stops viruses and bacteria from spreading," said Teacher.
P8	Father is making a tool for washing hands.
P9	Laraba asks, "How does this tool work?"
P10	"The wooden step tilts the container, and water flows out."
P11	"Wash with soap and water. Slowly count to 20 while you wash."
P12	"Clever Dad! Now, can you greet with your elbow?"
