P2	Every day Mumba and his brother Chanda walked to the field to get maize and groundnuts to eat. They were happy and thankful for a good harvest.
P3	One bright afternoon as they walked home from the field, they met a monkey. The monkey did not greet them. It looked at them and looked at their basket of food. Give me that food. The monkey shouted.
P4	Mumba and Chansa did not like the bad monkey and tried to hide their food basket. But the monkey grabbed it from them.@The monkey ate the food. The boys were sad. They went back home without any food.
P5	Where is the food? their father asked.@The monkey got it. The boys answered@Their father was not happy and there was no food for the family to eat.
