page_text:

P1	A crow was thirsty. He moved a very long distance in search for water for drinking but failed.
P2	He then tried to fly back. To the tree where he was living. It took him a long time because he was weak.
P3	As he was moving he saw water in a pot in someone's compound.
P4	The water was almost at the bottom of the pot. His beak could not reach the water in the pot. He thought of a way to get that water.
P5	An idea came to his mind. Hegot small stones He dropped one stone and the water in the pot jumped.
P6	The crow put his mouth and drunk the water droplets.
P7	He got another stone and repeated the exercise. He kept on doing this until he was satisfied.
