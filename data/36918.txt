page_text:

P1	Long ago, when the earth still lived in darkness, a young boy was born with an incredible power. His skin shined light on the earth. He was named Sun.
P2	Soon, everyone in the village knew of his power and asked for his help. But he could not help everyone at once. The villagers grew angry.
P3	Sun wanted peace. He looked to the sky and came up with a solution. Sun concentrated on the sky and slowly rose higher and higher.
P4	The villagers watched Sun rise to the sky. As Sun rose, he brought light to the whole village. Everyone thanked him.
P5	And so, Sun and the villagers came to an agreement. Sun would spend half the day in the sky and half with his family. In return, the villagers would never fight again.
P6	And that is the story of a boy named Sun.
