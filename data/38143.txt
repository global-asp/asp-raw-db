page_text:

P1	Jones had drank to much Gaderade (the drink that makes you grow tall). Although Jones really wanted to grow tall, but not as tall as he is right now because he is only 4 and he is already taller than his brother, James that's 7, and his mom
P2	Jones mom told Jones to go ride his bike with James. Firstly it was James that was helping Jones ride the bike but now Jones is helping James ride the bike. Because Jones legs were so long he had to streach his legs so wide to ride the bike
P3	Jones parents soon found out that Jones was struggling to ride the bike so they bought him a bigger bike. By the way James and there pet turkey hated the big bike because they had to stare at Jones long legs for the whole ride.
P4	But they kept a smile on there face so Jones wouldn't notice.                                              Because bob got tall his parents thought that it's a mirical, he just got older quickly. So his mom and dad told him to cook dinner.
P5	"Blee!" James screamed, this food taist horabel. James instantly spat the food out of his mouth. His parents tested the food "Blee!" Wha kind of food is thisðŸ¤®ðŸ¤¢, is he trying to kill us!  "I will so deal with him!"
P6	James marched his way into his room and was surprised to see Jones fast asleep but he was more surprised when he saw Jones legs sticking out of the bed. Besides, James couldn't even fit in the bed.
P7	On the  other hand James couldn't fit in the bed. Bang...Bang...Bang. Jones parents were walking up the stairs and they yelled and yelled at Jones and they told Jones to leave the house forever. By the way all the animals could hear screams
P8	So then James had to live in the wild. And that's the story of long legs.               THE END
