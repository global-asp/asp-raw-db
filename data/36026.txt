P1	A naughty little mouse with fur was sitting on the fence, watching the house of the Zwane family.  @@It was thinking about how it would get inside the house to be naughty! @@We all know that mice are very naughty.
P2	The naughty little mouse soon found a way inside the house. It climbed on a table and found a computer. @@It started chewing the cable. @@Do you see the naughtiness we are talking about? @@Just think about long teeth biting on the computer cable!
P3	Suddenly, a voice cried, "Don't bite that cable! The cable is my tail! You are hurting me!"@@The naughty little mouse with fur looked around to see who was speaking. It asked, "Who are you?"
P4	The computer mouse answered, "I am the computer mouse.  I stay here, this is my home."@@The naughty little mouse with fur laughed. "How can you say you are a mouse? I am a real mouse. You don't look like me."@@I will show you how a real mouse behaves," said the naughty little mouse with fur.
P5	It ran to the kitchen and stole a piece of cheese cake. It said, "Do you know how to eat cake? You don't even have a mouth! @@While cracking with laughter.
P6	The computer mouse pressed itself. @@Click, a picture of a large cake appeared on the computer screen. @@The naughty little mouse with fur was impressed.
P7	It thought for a moment, and then looked around the desk. It saw a pencil.@@The naughty little mouse with fur picked up the pencil and started chewing it. @@What a mess! Little pieces of pencil all over the desk.@@The naughty little mouse was pleased with itself. "Look at what a real mouse can do to wood!"
P8	The computer mouse pressed itself again. Click. "Look at what I can do to wood," it said. @@Tree stumps and logs appeared on the computer screen.  @@"Wow," said the naughty little mouse with fur. It was even more impressed.
P9	The naughty little mouse with fur asked the computer mouse, "Can you dance?"@@The naughty little mouse started to dance.
P10	It was so busy enjoying itself, that it didn't notice the house cat looking up at the table.@@The cat sprung on the table!@@"Today I am going to show you who I am!" meowed the cat as it reached for the naughty little mouse.
P11	The naughty little mouse with fur was terrified and started running. "Help, help!" it squeaked.@@The computer mouse pressed itself. Click, a video of a barking dog appeared on the computer screen. "Woof, woof!"@@The cat got a fright. It jumped off the table and ran away.@@The naughty little mouse with fur was safe.
P12	The naughty little mouse with fur hugged the computer mouse. @@"Thank you, you saved my life!" it said to the computer mouse.@@The little mouse with fur was now behaving.
