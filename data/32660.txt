page_text:

P1	Elephant and Hare are friends who like playing games but are now forgetting to have fun but are always competing.@They decided to compete at a game of football.
P2	Elephant started as the goal keeper and hare started as a player.  Hare scored many goals and danced in joy. He was a winner.
P3	Next the Hare was the goal keeper and the Elephant became the player. Elephant scored more goals because hare was smaller and did not fill up the post like Elephant did.
P4	Hare was so upset that he challenged Elephant to a race. Elephant thought he could win the race so he accepted the challenge.
P5	Hare was so swift that he got to the finish line while Elephant was still at the starting line. Hare danced for joy and gloated, this made Elephant very sad.
P6	Elephant decided that the person who could stand the longest on fire would be declared a final winner. Hare accepted the challenge but was afraid.
P7	So Elephant stood in the fire first, the fire was so intense that Elephant started to cry, he did not want to continue with the competition anymore. Hare agreed.
P8	Hare ran to get Elephant some water and first aid for his friend. They both agreed that it was foolishness to continue competing instead of having fun.
