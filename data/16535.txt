desc:	Nita’s hanging upside down. Can she turn the right way round?

page_text:

P1	Nita's hanging upside down,  her long hair tickling at the ground. The trees,  the grass,  the everything is all the wrong way round.
P2	Her feet,  they poke into the sky. Little Navi's walking by. He says,  "I've seen you here before. You're upside down again! What for?"
P3	His feet swim lightly in the air. She tries to hide behind her hair. "It's h-h-h-hard to t-t-talk",  she says to him. "I'm not the same. I don't fit in."
P4	Navi takes her by the hand. He wants to help her understand. They climb to Navi's look out spot. From up here they can see a lot. They perch and have a quiet stare at children playing here and there.
P5	Those kids are not the same at all.  Abe's round.
P6	Chi's freckled.
P7	Lala's extra tall.
P8	Bambam's wild and must be free.
P9	While Lulu's reading quietly.
P10	Look at Freya's crazy hair.
P11	And Sid wears glasses everywhere.
P12	And me,  I am just skin and bone. And you are you. You're not alone. Each human's sort of strange,  you see. That makes you just the same,  like me. This world is really one big game. To play,  we can't all be the same.
P13	Nita feels the right way round,  thanks to the new friend she's found. Upside down was never fun. Now she plays with everyone.
