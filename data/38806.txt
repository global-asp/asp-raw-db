page_text:

P1	Lolli is a young, bubbly and beautiful girl. She lives with her parents. Lolli's dad takes her to school and brings her back home every day.
P2	On one hot day on their way back home from school, they went inside a store to get coldrinks but Lolli saw something very interesting to her. It was a doll placed on the shelves.
P3	Lolli screamed to her daddy and said, " daddy look, the doll is looking at me it wants me to take it home!". However daddy did not have enough money on him to buy the doll at that moment but promised to get it for her tomorrow.
P4	As they walked out of the store, Lolli was crying and she was so sad. She even went on to say "I won't laugh or smile with you ever again", with tears in her eyes but daddy knew it was not true.
P5	The following day on their way home from school, daddy stopped in that same shop and went inside. Lolli cried for that same doll and daddy told her to take it and paid for it. As they went out of the store Lolli was so happy they hugged.
