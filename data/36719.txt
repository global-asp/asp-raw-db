page_text:

P1	Nongoma is a awsome village cause kids get to play people go to work early in the morning  , most kids of the village don't  get proper education  but it is the best village in nongoma people get up early to go and work  fix their veggies
P2	Some kids rather leave school and go do things that are wrong and what is unfair about this whole things is that the kids don't  get proper education  they don't  even care about  their own lives and safety they do wrong things all the time
P3	Some kids go to the markets to go and help out their elders at the markets they don't  even get clean water it is never fair at rural areas  cause most kids get to drink the dirty waters  and the rivers  waters are dirty
P4	At playing  time kids usually  get hurt while playing cause some kids  are rough they some hurt other kids feelings but it is a fun village
P5	Some kids at the village and their families  end up at the villlages when they are privileged  but then they couldn't  find proper sites they get fine food cause their parents  work  really hard for their families
P6	and that it for the nongoma  story and that's  my story it is my first time thank you i hope you enjoyed my short book that i wrote about nongoma
