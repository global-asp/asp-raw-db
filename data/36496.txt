P2	The birthday celebration was organized by her grand, grand children. Gogo Maria has more grand children than any other grannies in the community. Hence the community nicknamed her "Gogo wa bantwana".
P3	Her husband Mr Ben Baloyi, also invited his best friends to come and celebrate his wife's birthday.
P4	On that day, Gogo Maria received many presents from the invited guests and members of the community. Presents such as Blankets, a cellphone, sewing machine and a traditional three foot pot to cook "umqombothi", and traditional mageu.
P5	Many children also attended the birthday celebration of Gogo Maria, because she loved children so much and always read stories for them. Everyday after school, Gogo loved to read traditional stories to teach them about their culture.
P6	The local library donated fairy tales and traditional story books to Gogo Maria as presents. She was so excited to receive this present from a library. She knew that the library presents will help her to read and tell more stories.
P7	The following day children came back at Gogo's place for Storytelling. Then Gogo Maria decided to borrow them her books to read on their own. The reading was taking place in her favorite garden.
P8	Some were reading from the branches of  Mango trees. They were reading books and enjoying the Mangos at the same. Since that day, all the children of the community attended Gogo Maria's story telling everyday.
P9	Reading was the main activity that children were involved in everyday. So Gogo Maria managed to keep them away from the streets and entertained them through reading and story telling.
P10	She decided to open a garden library and named it Gogo Maria's garden library.
