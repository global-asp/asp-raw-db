P1	Knock, knock! 

There is a loud rap on the front door.
P2	Alake is very excited. 

"Who is there?" she asks.

"Mummy, we have a visitor!"
P3	"Okay," her mum replies. "That would be Mrs Hassan. Please open the door for her."
P4	Alake opens the door with a smile. "Welcome ma, please come in. My mother will be with you soon."

Mrs Hassan grins back at Alake.
P5	"Can I get you anything to drink?" asks Alake.

"I am fine, dear Alake, thank you," responds Mrs Hassan.
P6	"Good day, Mrs Hassan," says Alake's mum. "Sorry I kept you waiting."

"No problem my friend, Alake looked after me."
P7	Alake's mum beams a smile. 

"Yes, Alake is a perfect little hostess and I am so proud of her," she says to Mrs Hassan.
