desc:	On their adventure to get bananas for a birthday cake

page_text:

P1	"We should bake a banana cake today ," says Jabulile to her little brother Sipho. "Tomorrow is Gogo's birthday."@"What is tomorrow ?" asks Sipho.@"Tomorrow is the next day," answers Jabulile.
P2	“Tonight, we will go to bed and when we get up again, it will be tomorrow.”@“But then tomorrow will be today again, right?” Sipho wants to know.@“Yes,” says Jabulile, “and today will be yesterday.”@“Wow!” says Sipho and scratches his head.
P3	Jabulile smiles. “You will understand it one day! But let us go now! We need to get to the other side of the crocodile river before the morning is over.”
P4	“What do we need from the other side of the crocodile river?” asks Sipho with fear in his eyes.@“Bananas for the cake,” answers Jabulile.@“And how do we get there?” Sipho wonders.@“I guess we can swim,” suggests Jabulile.
P5	"Of course you cannot swim!" says a huge Hippo when Sipho and Jabulile arrive at the river. "Why do you think it is called crocodile river?"@"Because ... there are crocodiles?" Sipho guesses.
P6	“Exactly!” answers the Hippo. “And where there are crocodiles, humans cannot swim! You two need to take the bridge.”
P7	“Oh no!” says Jabulile, “The bridge is broken and it’s almost noon already.”@“Noon? What is noon?” Sipho asks.@“The middle of the day when the sun is at the highest point in the sky."
P8	"We need to fix the bridge as fast as possible, otherwise we will not have enough time to bake the cake tonight.”@Sipho and Jabulile both try to fix the bridge, but they cannot lift the wooden planks by themselves.
P9	It is already afternoon, when the Hippo appears again.@“You must work together,” it says.@And the Hippo is right: As soon as Jabulile and Sipho help each other, they manage to lift the planks and fix the bridge.
P10	“Thank you for the help, Hippo!” says Jabulile as she crosses the bridge.@“And for saving my life!” says Sipho, staring at a crocodile.
P11	“Now we need to be quick! We need to get bananas and then go all the way back home before night falls.”@“The night is falling?” asks Sipho, shocked. “From where? From the bridge?”
P12	“No!” answers Jabulile and laughs. “That just means before it gets dark.”
P13	Despite Jabulile’s concerns that it might get late, the two siblings manage to find bananas soon after they cross the bridge. And so, they have enough time to get back home and bake the cake before bedtime.
P14	“Did you know, Baba?” says Sipho to his dad who helps them with the cake. “Tonight, we will go to bed and when we get up again, it will be tomorrow.”
