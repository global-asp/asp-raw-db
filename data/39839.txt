P2	Because of his behaviour, people didn't liked him at all.His rules were very harsh. At the end of the month,he  never paid his workers their wages.Whenever the workers went for their payments he  would send them back home.
P3	When the workers wanted to quit their jobs, he would threatened them.All the people of the kingdom were very angry with him and wished he could die soon.Most of people cursed him while others wished  him a bad future.
P4	The people could not  tolerate him any longer.They decided to unite to fight against him.As wise men said unity is strength.Everyone was ready for anything as longer as the bad king will not be ruling anymore.They fought him and his army.
