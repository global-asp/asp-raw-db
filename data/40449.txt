page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, in a village near a river lived an old woman. She was a sad old woman. She was not happy. One day a fairy  visited her. The fairy wanted to help the old woman.
P2	“How can I help you?” The fairy asked.
P3	“I do not like living in this  small hut, in the village.” The old woman answered. “I want to live in a house with big rooms and a big bed.”
P4	“I will help you.” The fairy said and waved her hands in the air. The old woman turned around the house and felt dizzy.
P5	The old woman found herself in a house bigger than the hut in the village. The house had big rooms and a big comfortable bed. She was happy.
P6	Soon the old woman was sad again. The fairy visited her.@“Why are you sad? Is the house not big enough?” The fairy asked.
P7	“No” The old woman shouted. “I want a large house, with several large rooms. I do not like this one.”
P8	“I will help you.” The fairy said and waved her hands in the air once again. The woman turned around the house and felt dizzy.
P9	The old woman found herself in a large house with larger rooms. She was happy, life was good.
P10	Soon the old woman was sad again. The fairy visited her. “Why are you sad, don’t you like your new house?”@“No,” the old woman said. “I want to have the biggest house on earth. This house is too small.”
P11	The fairy was not  happy.@The old woman was greedy.@The fairy waved her hands in the air angrily and the woman felt herself turn around the house.
P12	The old woman was surprised. She found herself in her old hut. She looked for the fairy but did not find her.@The old woman learnt to be content with what she had.@THE END
