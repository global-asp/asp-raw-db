P1	Once upon a time there was a shepherd. He had no grass to feed his pig, sheep and goat,  He has no barn to keep them warm.
P2	So he decided to take them some where, some where in the neighborhood where they colud get food and shelter.
P3	The sheperd boy said "I could sell them for a quarter each" but the man was negotiating for a lower price.
P4	The man said "i only want the goat" but the shepherd boy said "friends are meant to be together. I want all of them to be together."
P5	The shepherd boy sold the sheep,  the goat and the pig for a quarter each. But he was sad as he headed home.
P6	He realized they weren't just animals but they were also his friends. So he came back to return the money and take his friends home.
P7	"They are mine" the man said "i wont give them back" but the shepherd  boy kept on begging.
P8	"I realized they are not just animals but also my friends" said the shepherd boy but the man asked "why did you sell them in the first place."
P9	The old lady heard the argument and said "if you go on a quest for me and show me you really love your animals i will give you back with a barn and a perfect house."
P10	Since the shepherd boy loves his animals  he did as the old lady asked and took home his three best friends to a perfect home and a barn.
