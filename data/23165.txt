P1	Knock, Knock! There is a loud rap on the front door.
P2	Alake is very excited. "Who is there?", she yells.
"Mummy..... we have a visitor!"
P3	"Okay," her mum replies. "That would be Mrs. Hassan and her baby. Please open the door for them."
P4	Alake opens the door with a smile.
"Welcome ma, please have a seat. My mother will be with you soon."
Mrs. Hassan grins back at Alake as she starts playing with the baby.
P5	"Please have some water ma'am. Can I get you anything else?" asks Alake.
"I am fine with this dear Alake, Thank you." responds Mrs. Hassan.
P6	"Good day Mrs. Hassan," says Alake's mum as she comes into the sitting room. "Sorry I kept you waiting"
"No problem my friend, Alake has kept us well entertained."
P7	Alake's mum beams a smile at her. 
"Yes," she murmurs. "Alake is a perfect little hostess and I am so proud of her."
