page_text:

P1	It was Monday morning. We assembled as we usually did, anxiously waiting for the principal's speech. @@The speech was about the mid-term break. The principal urged us to continue following the school routine as usual.
P2	We were all happy and ready to go home for a full week's break. @@My three siblings and I lived with Aunt Maria, her two teenage children and grandmother. @@I could not wait to see them all.
P3	The next morning, my aunt arrived to accompany me home. I was ready with my bag. @@We boarded a bus. I sat next to a window in order to take in the beautiful view of the countryside.
P4	My siblings ran to meet me. My cousins had prepared delicious meals to welcome me. @@I was happy to be able to help around the house.@@Aunt Maria has been taking care of us since the loss of our parents.
P5	The one week break went very first. Aunt Maria bought for me some of the items I needed to return to school.@@Although she could not get everything for me, I was grateful for her effort and what she managed to get for me.
P6	I went back to school the next day. Not long after returning, schools closed due to the outbreak of the Corona virus.@@Before we assembled, each of us had packed their boxes with all our belongings.
P7	We heard that the virus was in China. We thought it would not reach us! @@Some pupils were happy to be going back home.@I was not, because I knew I would not do much school work at home. @@"I hope I return to school soon," I thought.
P8	One day, grandmother fainted. We thought she would get better by resting at home.@@When she went to hospital, doctors treated only Covid-19 patients.@@The day my grandmother died was the saddest day in 2020!
