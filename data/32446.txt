desc:	An old man helps a snake

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, in the days when animals could talk, an old and good man went into the bush to look for firewood.
P2	It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining brightly and the birds were singing. It was a party day in the jungle!
P3	Along the way, the old man suddenly heard a low voice shouting, "Help me! Help me!"
P4	He went to the place where the voice came from, and he saw a big snake with a huge stone on top of it.
P5	"Oh, my friend! This heavy stone is resting on me and I can't get out. Can you help me get out?" the snake asked the man.
P6	So the man lifted the stone away. But then suddenly the snake said, ''Ha, you are no longer my friend, I will bite you."
P7	The man shouted, "Oh! Wait! Don't bite me. Why don't we go and see the hare? I am sure he will help us sort this out."
P8	So they went to see the hare and told him what had happened. The hare said, "All right, now let's go back to the place where all this happened."
P9	So they went back to the place where the snake was when the man passed by.
P10	The snake went there and the hare told the man to put the stone back where it was when he came along. So he did.
P11	Finally, the hare turned to the man and said, "Now go away and leave the snake where it is!" And that is the end of the story!
