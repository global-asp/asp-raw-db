P1	One million years ago, a soccer gem was formed.@@When it was discovered, people fought to possess this powerful jewel.
P2	During the first soccer world war the gem was lost. No one knew what happened to it.@@Many years passed. The soccer gem would only be found when the greatest soccer star was born.
P3	Not long ago, there was a boy named David. He was from a poor family.
P4	Before David's father died, he gave the soccer gem to his son.@@At first, the boy didn't know the power of the jewel.
P5	He was a teenager when he first used the gem to play soccer.@@David hadn't gone to school. But with the gem's power, he won every single match he played with his friends.
P6	He realised that he could make money for his family from playing soccer. @@He would open a shop for his mother, and send his brother and sisters to school.
P7	David became the best professional soccer player that anyone had seen.@@It was even said that he was from another world!
P8	The soccer star who will never be forgotten!
