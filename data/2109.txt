desc:	On Etabo’s sixth birthday

page_text:

P1	I live in Kakuma village,  a very hot dry place,  full of thorny trees,  and more goats than people. Even the market place is quiet,  with only a few small shops. Most people use bicycles for transport.
P2	One morning my mother called me and said,  "Etabo,  today you turn six years old. We have a present for you." "What is it? What is it?" I asked eagerly. "Tomorrow we're going by bus to the market in Eldoret," she replied,  "And we're taking you with us!" My first visit to the city! I was so excited that I could hardly sleep that night.
P3	The next day at the Kakuma bus stop,  I stood between my mother and my aunt. I wore my new pair of blue jeans and a red T-shirt. I felt very small between my tall slender mother and my big round aunt.
P4	The bus was very full,  so I had to sit on my mother's lap. Tired from the heat and excitement,  I slept the whole way and saw nothing.
P5	The sun was just rising when we reached Eldoret market. At the entrance was a woman selling grains. Over in one corner there were two men getting ready to lay out their sweet potatoes. Over in another corner was a woman holding a shiny blue helicopter. "Mother,  mother,  look at that helicopter!" But mother pulled me away.
P6	In the middle of the market,  there was a large stall that sold different types of fruit. Some of them I had never seen before. "What are the names of these fruits?" I asked my mother. She pointed,  "These are oranges,  and these are guavas." I turned around and said,  "And these?"
P7	Of all the fruits at the stall,  I liked the apples most. I liked their shape and colour. I wondered how they tasted. I turned to mother and said,  "Could you buy one for me?"
P8	As soon as she gave me the apple,  I let go of my mother's hand,  took the fruit with both hands,  and bit into the juicy flesh. I had never enjoyed a fruit the way I enjoyed that apple. All I cared about was my apple.
P9	When I finished the apple,  I looked up to talk to my mother. But she was not there!  My mother and aunt had gone.  I looked to the right,  then to the left. But they were nowhere to be seen. "Have you seen my mother?" I asked the women selling potatoes nearby. They took no notice. I started to cry.
P10	A while later,  a woman took me by the hand and led me to a place where there were other children. A big man with a thick beard asked,  "What's your name,  boy?" "E-ta-bo," I replied through my tears.
P11	I wondered if children were also sold at the market. I stopped crying and looked around to see if anyone would buy the children in the room. Soon a woman came in and picked up one of the children. "I will be the next one to be taken away," I thought. "And then I'll never see home again!" I started crying once more.
P12	When I heard the big man with the thick beard saying,  "Where is Etabo?" I cried even harder. "I do not want to go with you!" I sobbed. I hid away from him.
P13	When my mother and aunt heard my name,  they rushed to the room. "Etabo,  Etabo!" a familiar voice called. It was my mother.
P14	As I got up to hug my mother,  my aunt said,  "Etabo,  we were looking for you to give you your birthday present." And from a big bag,  my aunt pulled out a shiny blue helicopter.  "It's yours!" she said.
