page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in the village of Elewamambo, there lived a short and handsome boy. His name was Benz. He always portrayed weak and unpleasing characters contrary to what his parents had taught him.This made his parents unhappy with him.
P2	As the days passed by, Benz did not change his bad behaviour. One chilly morning, Benz woke up and he said to himself, "I will go to the bush today and see what kind of animals live there." Having no time to waste, he proceeded to the bush.
P3	In the bush, he saw a big tree with the beautiful flowers. "Wow!" Said Benz happily with a broad smile on his face. Benz looked up the tree and saw a beehive. He said, "I will have to see what is in the beehive."
P4	Within a span of seconds, Benz took a stone and threw strongly to the beehive.The insects inside were destructed. Suddenly, a swarm of angry bees came out and flooded as they scattered allover, even in the village.
P5	The angry bees attacked people and the domestic animals badly. Benz was mostly attacked but he managed to escape.The people were rushed to the hospital for medication in order to relieve the pain of the stingy insects
P6	After treatment, Benz went home feeling ashamed of the naughty action he had done. "What have you done?" Benz's mother asked angrily. Benz confessed that he was the cause of the bees attack.They punished him for that silly mistake.
P7	After the punishment, Benz had to go and apologize to each person who was affected by his reckless behavior. He had to pick flowers, write apology letters and personally deliver them to the victims. Benz did what was required of him.
P8	Since that day, Benz was sorry for his actions and he assured his parents that he will always obey them. He promised to be a better person and change his way for the best. Benz became a good boy to his parents.His parents were proud of him.
