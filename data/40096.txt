P1	Luntha loves bananas. Sadly, there are no bananas at the market.@@A big truck takes all the bananas to the city.
P2	One day, Luntha asked his father, "Can't we grow our own bananas?" "That is a great idea!" Luntha's father replied.@@They quickly went to see a local farmer. They bought twenty suckers to start their own garden.
P3	Luntha watered the banana plants every day.@@Three months later, the bananas developed broad leaves.
P4	After nine months, the bananas started flowering.@@They produced big flower buds.
P5	In the 10th month, the banana fingers grew bigger.
P6	In the 12th month, the bananas were fully mature.
P7	They harvested three plants.@@"We cannot eat all these bananas dad," said Luntha.
P8	They refused to sell the bananas to the big truck.@@They took the extra bananas to the market. They made a lot of money at the market.
