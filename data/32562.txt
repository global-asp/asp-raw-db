page_text:

P1	Sakima lived with his parents and his four year old sister. They lived on a rich man's land. Their grass-thatched hut was at the end of a row of trees.
P2	When Sakima was three years old,  he fell sick and lost his sight. Sakima was a talented boy.
P3	Sakima did many things that other six year old boys did not do. For example, he could sit with older members of the village and discuss important matters.
P4	Sakima's parents  worked at the rich man's house. They left home early in the morning and returned late in the evening. Sakima was left with his little sister.
P5	Sakima loved to sing songs. One day his mother asked him, "Where do you learn these songs from, Sakima?"
P6	Sakima answered, "I just know them, mother. I hear them in my mind and then I sing."
P7	Sakima liked to sing for his little sister, especially,  if she felt hungry. His sister would listen to him singing his favourite song. She would sway to the soothing tune.
P8	"Can you sing it again and again, Sakima," his sister would beg him. Sakima would accept and sing it over and over again.
P9	One evening when his parents returned home, they were very quiet. Sakima knew that there was something wrong.
P10	"What is wrong, mother, father?" Sakima asked. Sakima learned that the rich man's son was missing. The man was very sad and lonely.
P11	"I can sing for him. He might be happy again," Sakima told his parents. But his parents dismissed him. "He is very rich. You are only a blind boy. Do you think your song will help him?"
P12	However,  Sakima did not give up. His little sister supported him. She said, "Sakima's songs soothe me when I am hungry. They will soothe the rich man too."
P13	The following day, Sakima asked his little sister to lead him to the rich man's house.
P14	He stood below a window and began to sing his favourite song. Slowly, the head of the rich man began to show through the window.
P15	The workers stopped what they were doing. They listened to Sakima's beautiful song. But one man said,  "Nobody has been able to console the boss. Does this blind boy think he will console him?"
P16	Sakima finished singing his song and turned to leave. But the rich man rushed out and said, "Please sing again."
P17	At that very moment, two men came carrying someone on a stretcher. They had found the rich man's son beaten up and left on the side of the road.
P18	The rich man was so happy to see his son again. He rewarded Sakima for consoling him. He took his son and Sakima to hospital to check if Sakima could see again.
