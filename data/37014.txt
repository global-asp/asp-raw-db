P1	*SECTION* — BEGINNING FINGER MATH@@Prerequisite:  Can count up to 10; Number Cards@@ACTIVITY — MAGIC HANDS — ADD AND SUBTRACT@@Do this magic trick slowly enough so your child can see what is going on. For addition, count the number of raised fingers on your left hand, say 3. Count the number of raised fingers on your right hand, say 1. Make sure you pick two numbers that add up to 5 or less. Now, bring the two hands together and poof — the fingers on your right hand are transferred to the left hand, where there are now 4 fingers raised. Magic! Summarize by saying "3 fingers plus 1 more finger creates 4 fingers. Tada!"
P2	For subtraction, raise some fingers on your left hand, say 4 of them. Have your right hand reach over and grab some of the fingers, say 1 of them. Presto, there will be 3 fingers left raised on the left hand and 1 raised on the right hand. @@Verbally summarize this saying that 4 take away 1 gives three, or you can say that you have broken 4 into two pieces which are 3 and 1. The latter wording emphasizes the concept of number bonds, which are pairs of numbers that add up to a given total.@@Occasionally, throw in the following special cases. For addition, let one or both of the hands have 0 fingers raised and show nothing changes when adding 0. For subtraction, subtract all the fingers so none are left over, and sometimes subtract none of the fingers to show that nothing changes.
P3	ACTIVITY — FLASH NUMBERS@@It is useful for your child to easily recognize numbers of objects. Practice this in two ways. @@One way is to use Number Cards with ten frames. Pick a card at random and playfully see if your child can recognize the quantity. For variety, have your child quiz you sometimes.@@The other way is to use fingers. Show some fingers on one or both hands and have your child recognize the total count. When two hands are used for numbers over five, one of the hands should have 5 fingers raised — that way it looks like a ten frame.
P4	ACTIVITY — WHAT'S MISSING@@Count a small number of little things. Hide some of them while your child is not looking. When your child looks back, ask how many are hidden.@@For example, suppose you have 6 raisins on a table. Have your child look away and cover 2 of them with a bowl. When your child looks back, count out the 4 visible raisins and ask how many raisins are under the bowl if there are 6 in total. @@One way for your child to figure this out is to "count on" from 4 to 6 — as your child counts 4, 5, and 6, start with 0 fingers raised and raise one finger at a time to arrive at 2 raised fingers. @@Similarly, your child can do almost the same thing by "counting down" from 6 to 4. Seeing that 4 plus 2 more is 6 is tied together with taking 2 away from 6 to get 4 is great practice for understanding fact families.
P5	*SECTION* — FIGURES@@Prerequisite:  Can count up to 10@@GAME — FINDING SQUARES@@Create an empty 5 by 5 grid using five horizontal and vertical lines.  Players take turns putting their tokens on points where the lines cross in the grid. The first player with four tokens on the corners of a square of any size wins. @@As your child gets experienced with this, change the rules to allow squares with diagonal sides.
P6	ACTIVITY — CUTTING SYMMETRIC SHAPES@@Create designs by folding a piece of paper and cutting the paper while it is folded. This is called Kirigami. Folding the paper once and cutting it creates a design with one side the mirror image of the other. Experiment with cutting out faces, lamps, or geometric shapes.@@If your child makes two intersecting folds, cutting this paper creates designs that are mirror images in two directions. This makes it easy to create designs such as flowers.@@Experiment with various folds and cuts. Create snowflake designs by starting with the same two folds as in the last example, and then doing two more folds that split the folded paper into thirds.
P7	ACTIVITY — CONNECT THE DOTS@@Complete fun drawings by connecting numbered dots. One way is to take a simple drawing, say of a house, remove some straight lines and replace them with numbered dots, that when connected in order recreate the original drawing.@@String Art@@Another way is to make abstract drawings by connecting points with the same number along opposite sides of an angle.@@A third way is to put some dots, say 8, evenly spaced on a circle. Play with creating different patterns by connecting the dots in order, or connecting every second dot, or every third dot.
P8	*SECTION* — NUMBER STORIES@@Prerequisite:  Counting to ten; Beginning skills with single-digit addition and subtraction@@ACTIVITY — GIVE FUN NAMES TO NUMBERS@@Gently introduce the idea of variable names by starting to use silly names for numbers in activities that involve missing numbers.
P9	GAME — I'M THINKING OF A NUMBER@@There are two people - the Puzzler, who thinks of a number, and the Questioner, who discovers the number.. To start, the Puzzler says, "Bowser is a number from 0 to 12." The Questioner then asks questions of the form "How does Bowser compare to 4?" The Puzzler then says Bowser is smaller, equal to, or larger than 4. @@Make this into a game by counting the questions. After alternating turns, the player asking the smaller number of questions wins. Another option is to limit the number of questions allowed. This leads to some interesting questions such as, if the range is from 0 to 12, is it always possible to find the number with three questions.@@As your child's mathematics develops, use other kinds of questions, such as "Is Bowser even?" or "Is Bowser a prime number?"
P10	ACTIVITY — BAG GAME — ADD AND SUBTRACT@@You and your child each pretend to have a bag with some number of things. One person creates a story such as: "Your bag has 3 raisins and mine has one more. How many do I have?" After your child gets comfortable with this, let your child come up with the question some of the time — this is often great fun for them, especially if you make the occasional "mistake."@@These stories can get more elaborate with experience. For example, the story could be "I have two fewer cookies than you do, and together we have six cookies. How many cookies do you have?" Another example, "You have twice as many candies as I do, and together we have nine pieces. How many pieces do you have?"
P11	The use of bags and pieces of food can be replaced by the idea of a fish bowl with two (or more) kinds of fish, or with any other imagery that appeals to your child. For a fish bowl, you could create a story such as "There are seven fish in the bowl, and there is one more goldfish than there are tetras. How many goldfish are there?" @@Another option is to use names for numbers and say Spot is 3 more than T-Rex, and together they add up to 7. What are Spot and T-Rex?
P12	ACTIVITY — MATH STORIES@@Stories are a fun way to add interest to calculations. Here two examples of such stories:@@There are four chairs in a room. At first there are two people, but then three more come along. Can everyone sit down? This is more interesting than simply asking if  2 + 3 is larger than 4. @@My two friends and I are having ice cream. I will give each of my friends one more scoop than I get. If there are ten scoops of ice cream, how many scoops of ice cream can I have?@@Pick topics that interest your child, such as food or animals. As your child gets better at these stories, let some of the stories be somewhat vague so your child will need to analyze more and learn to ask clarifying questions.
P13	*SECTION* — COMPARING UP TO 10@@Prerequisite:  Counting forward and backward between 0 and 10@@GAME — NUMBER LINE BATTLESHIP@@Each player has two number lines, one for their battleships and one for their guesses. These number lines are drawn on paper and go from 0 to 12 (or higher if the children can count higher). Out of sight, on their battleship number line, each player places tokens on two numbers that will be their battleships.
P14	After the setup, the players take turns guessing numbers. When a player makes a guess, the other player says how close the guess was to the nearest target — the guesser then marks down that information on their second number line. The first person to get all the targets wins.@@There are several variations to make this more challenging. A wider range of numbers can be used. The response to a guess can be a range of distances rather than an exact amount - for example: "the nearest ship is 1 or 2 away." Another variation is to have ships that are two or three spaces in length.
P15	PUZZLE — SUDOKU — COMPARING@@Greater Than Sudoku puzzles start with the same rules as regular Sudoku - each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and subregion. Additionally, if there is a less than or greater than symbol between two cells, then the numbers in the cells must obey that relationship.@@Tell a child who has never seen a comparison symbol that the bigger number is on the side with the wider part of the symbol. Some people say that the symbol is a hungry alligator and it always wants its mouth to point in the direction of the larger number.
P16	A useful strategy is to first look for where the smallest and largest numbers are. As your child gets better, make the puzzles more challenging by leaving out more of the inequality symbols.@@Make these puzzles by using a finished Sudoku puzzle. Put in greater than and less than signs on a blank grid of the same geometry. If your child gets stuck, put in a few numbers to help your child get started.
P17	*SECTION* — BEING LOGICAL@@Prerequisite:  Counting to 12; Early logical and problem solving skills@@ACTIVITY — MAKE ME A LIAR@@Someone makes a statement and the other players attempt to show that the person is lying.@@One type of statement is to say something is always true. Examples of this are: all trucks have four wheels, all rectangles are squares, all birds can fly, and the moon comes out at night.@@Another type of statement is of the form "if __, then ___ ." Examples of this are: if today is Monday, then it is a school day; if I don't eat for three hours, then I am hungry; and if a person is taller than someone, then they are older.
P18	GAME — CODEBREAKER@@The CodeMaster creates a code, and the other player is the CodeBreaker. Suppose the code has three positions each of which can be from 1 to  5. An example of such a code would be 321.@@To break the code, the CodeBreaker guesses a code and the CodeMaster says how close the guess is. For example, if the CodeBreaker guesses 131, then the CodeMaster would say that one spot was exactly right and one other spot had the correct number but in the wrong place. Play continues until the CodeBreaker figures out the code. The number of guesses is the score for the CodeBreaker. The lowest score wins.@@To add challenge, have a maximum number of questions that the CodeBreaker is allowed to ask. Other variations are: allow or disallow repeated numbers in the code, use shorter or longer lengths for the code, and use a narrower or wider range of numbers for each place of the code.
P19	PUZZLE — 15 SLIDING PUZZLE  @@Start with a 4 x 4 empty grid of squares formed by 5 horizontal and vertical lines. Use a set of 15 pieces of paper the size of the grid squares, and number the pieces of paper from 1 to 15. @@The puzzle starts by having someone place the pieces of paper on the grid. The object of the puzzle is to get the pieces of paper in order with only the lower right hand corner of the grid empty. To achieve this, a piece of paper can be moved if it is adjacent to the empty square - in which case it can be slid into that space. @@Depending on how the person sets up the puzzle, the puzzle may or may not be solvable.
P20	A 4 x 4 grid is too hard for a beginner, so start with something smaller. The grid could be as small as 2 x 2 or as big as the child wants. The number of numbered pieces of paper will always be one less than the size of the grid. For example, on a 2 x 3 grid use the cards from 1 to 5.@@To create these puzzles, you have two options. The first is to place the squares randomly, in which case you have a 50 / 50 chance of the position being solvable. Alternatively, you can start by placing the pieces of paper in the final position and then making a series of legal moves to move the paper around. When you are all done, you are guaranteed that the puzzle is solvable.
P21	*SECTION* — FINGER MATH@@Prerequisite:  Counting forward and backward from 0 to 10@@ACTIVITY — FINGER ADDITION TO 10@@There are two methods for this:@@Method 1: Use this method if both numbers are 5 or less. For the example of adding 4 and 2, put up 4 fingers on one hand and 2 fingers on the other. Then, bring the two hands together — Tada! Your child will see 4 and 2 brought together becomes 6.
P22	Method 2:  Use "counting on" from one of the numbers to reach any sum of up to 10.@@To add 4 and 2, put up 4 fingers on one hand, and count aloud from 0 to 2. For each spoken number after 0, put up one more finger. When 2 is reached, there should be 6 fingers raised.@@This method allows addition of numbers bigger than 5. Your child will come to realize that it's easier to start with the larger number of fingers raised and count on using the smaller number.
P23	ACTIVITY — FINGER SUBTRACTION TO 10@@There are two mental models for subtraction. It can be thought of as "take away" or "difference," and your child should be comfortable with both models. Here is 8 - 5 calculated both ways:@@Take Away: Think of  8 - 5 as what is left after you start with 8 things and take 5 of them away. Start with 8 fingers raised. Next, count aloud from 0 to 5, and for each number after 0 put one finger down. When 5 is reached in the count, there will be three fingers left up.
P24	Difference: This model views 8 - 5 as finding the difference or distance between the two numbers. Start with 5 fingers raised. Then count the new fingers being raised, and when there are 8 fingers raised the difference of 3 will have been counted.@@This method uses the "counting on" addition method to find the number to add to 5 to get 8.@@Mix in problems where a number is subtracted from itself to get 0.
