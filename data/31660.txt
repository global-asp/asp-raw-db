page_text:

P1	Luke 18:1-8@@Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart. He said:@@In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people.
P2	There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, "Give me justice against my adversary."
P3	For a long while he refused to help the widow.
P4	But later on he said to himself, "Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people, yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas."
P5	And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says! Won't God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them?"
P6	"I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
