page_text:

P1	There was a husband and wife with two daughters. They lived happily until one day the mother died. @@The man married again. His new wife did not get along with his daughters. @@The man was confused. He loved his daughters but he also loved his new wife.
P2	In the end he decided to send away his daughters. He took them on a journey. @@When they reached a big tree, they sat under it to rest. He said to them, "My daughters wait for me here until I return."
P3	While in the bush, the man cut off his finger nails. He said, "My nails, I am abandoning my daughters. When they call for me, respond to them."@@The girls waited under the tree for their father, but he did not return.
P4	They called, "Father! Father! Where are you?" A voice responded, "I am coming! I am coming!" It was the man's nails.@@They searched in the direction of the voice, but could not find their father. Finally, they realised he was not coming back.
P5	The two girls returned to the tree and prayed loudly, "Creator of this tree, hear us." @@The tree split into pieces and became a nice house. @@Again the girls prayed, "God of fruits, feed us." Fruit dropped from the sky for them to eat.
P6	Rather than thinking about their father, the daughters chose to live their lives as best they could @@They stayed in the house and ate only the fruit which dropped from the sky. But after a while they wanted to eat meat.
P7	The girls knew that Hyena lived near their home. He kept many animals and ate meat every day. @@Eventually, they decided to go and steal meat from Hyena. So the older girl went alone to Hyena's house.
P8	Hyena was sitting at his fire but the girl did not see him. He caught her and tied her up. @@Hyena decided to boil her for supper. He put the girl into a pot with water and lit the fire, and then he went out.
P9	After a while, the younger girl began to wonder why her sister had not returned. @@She went to Hyena's house and saw her sister in the pot on the fire.@@She prayed, "God of pots, please don't let my sister die."
P10	Immediately, the pot broke into pieces and the older sister fell out alive. @@The girls ran away before Hyena came back. When they arrived at their house they found many riches there.@@Many years passed and the sisters grew to women.
P11	One day, a man wearing old and dirty clothes knocked on the sisters' door, asking for help. @@When the older sister looked at him, she was reminded of their father. She asked the man his name and where he came from.
P12	When he finished explaining, the women knew that this old man was their father. They told him their part of the story.@@The man wept with joyful surprise. "Can you forgive me?" he asked. The sisters welcomed their father and invited him to stay. @@And in time, they forgave him.
