page_text:

P1	'When will dog bring news' pondered the large cat 'why I don't know,but I'm sure the time will come soon.' Said the wise chicken
P2	'Cat chicken I  bring you news.'said the tired dog
P3	And told them the news and started to walk horses way
P4	Horse told them what he had heard
P5	That the king needed help but his plan was not told
P6	But the chosen one went in blindly
P7	And he would have to fight a near by village
P8	He said they were taking to much food
P9	And soon the jungle would be there's again
P10	Soon they started to walk again as they said there farewells
