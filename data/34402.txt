page_text:

P1	Nomalanga lived with her parents in a homestead called Kuthuleni. @@She was the only child in the family and she woke up early every day to graze the cattle.@@Nomalanga's beauty was like the rising sun.
P2	Nomalanga was adored by all boys where she lived, and she was envied by all the girls.  @@One day, a group of girls decided to kidnap her.  @@That day after grazing the cattle, she was stopped by the girls as she returned home.
P3	"Hello Nomalanga, beauty queen of eKuthuleni," greeted Jojo, a tall and scrawny girl. @@"Hello dear sisters," Nomalanga replied. @@"You are coming with us to the other side of Jevu mountain," stated Cebile forcefully. Nomalanga was very frightened.
P4	They all climbed mountain Jevu, huffing and puffing until they reached top.  @@Suddenly, the girls grabbed Nomalanga and put her in a big sack. @@Nomalanga was kicking and screaming, "Sisters, I am begging you, let me go!"
P5	"Shut up Miss Beautiful! We are tired of your beauty and how everyone praises you for it," responded Jojo angrily.@@"What message do you want us to give to your parents after we are done with you?" asked Zozo.
P6	Nomalanga began to sing a song that her grandmother had taught her. It was a magical song. @@"Gumbeqe, gomboqo, qekelele, zwi." Her voice sounded as sweet as honey. @@"Gomboqo, qekelele, gumbeqe, zwi. Qekelele, gumbeqe, gomboqo, zwi."
P7	As she continued to sing the song, Nomalanga grew bigger and bigger, and her skin turned to gold.  @@All the girls fell on the ground. They watched fearfully as Nomalanga became a golden statue on top of mountain Jevu!
P8	In this way, Nomalanga's beauty continued even beyond her life.
