P1	The moon and stars appear at night. @@They bring light at night. They are up in the space. @@When you are in the space, you are able to see a bigger area on the ground.
P2	There is no air or water in space. Astronauts must wear special suits to survive.@@The suits have oxygen to breathe, and water to drink.@@The suits also protect the astronauts from the cold, heat and space dust.
P3	Astronauts tell Andzani and Nsovo that a person who travels to the moon is called an astronaut. @@"Going to the moon?" asked Andzani and Nsovo. "You will never reach the moon, it's far."@@"You can travel to the moon. There are spacecrafts which are vehicles made to fly in space. @@They work like aeroplanes which travel around the globe."
P4	Spacecrafts can travel far in the sky. @@It works just like other modes of transport, like cars. They use fuel to travel.
P5	Many satellites travel around the earth. The moon is a natural satellite.@@Satellites made by humans help us with activities such as weather forecasts and making maps. @@Satellites always move in a circle around a bigger object in space. This movement is called an orbit.
P6	Andzani and Nsovo learnt a lot about space travel. @@They also learned that there are nine planets. They follow a particular systematic order.
P7	The earth is the third planet from the sun. @@That's where people live.
P8	Andzani and Nsovo learnt about telescopes. @@"A telescope is a tool which helps us to see things much further away than our natural eyes can see," explains the first austronaut.@@The second astronaut says, "If something is very far, it might be a challenge to see it clearly. A telescope brings an object closer to you." "Oh!" said Andzani and Nsovo happily.@@Andzani, Nsovo and the four astronauts took the telescopes to see distant objects. They were excited.
