P1	He is not expecting visitors.

"Hello, we have come to visit you!" they announce.

"Welcome!" he replies.
P2	The man rushes to his neighbour.

He calls, "Friends are visiting and I do not have any food. Please lend me three loaves of bread."
P3	The neighbour responds, "Do not bother me. The door is shut, and we are all in bed. I cannot give you anything."
P4	But the first man continues to knock on his neighbour's door. 

He keeps knocking. He keeps asking. 

Eventually, the door opens.
P5	And so, the man was able to return to his friends with bread.
