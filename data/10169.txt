page_text:

P1	Inyang was an herds-boy. His father trusted him with important duty. His father loved him because evening the cows came home with full stomachs.
P2	One day,  Inyang asked his father to allow him migrate with other young men with cows in search of green pasture. This was a tradition practiced in their pastoralist community. Like other fathers his father gave Inyang permission.
P3	In the new place,  Inyang grew thin due to lack of enough food. There was nobody to cook for him. Inyang depended on the little milk from one of the cows.
P4	One day Inyang went in the forest and caught a weaver bird. Instead of eating it,  Inyang sent it to his home with a message for his parents. The bird wanted to help Inyang because he spared its life.
P5	The bird flew for long but with rests along the way. Every time the bird thought of how good Inyang was,  it wanted do everything to save him. For this reason,  the bird kept it flying and flying!
P6	The bird flew and flew. Then from high up it spotted Inyang's village.
P7	From Inyangs' description the bird easily identified the hut with red mud. The bird was happy for now Inyang would get help!
P8	Form the top of the hut and with a soft and unique sound it began singing. At first it attracted no attention but as the sweet music continued people's attention was caught. The bird seemed to send some message and people got closer to it.
P9	The bird after the crowd gathered,  explained how Inyang was suffering alone in the grassing field. It appealed to his parents to save him. His parents then prepared food and planned to go for Inyang.
P10	They carried food for him among other things. The set off their journey across rivers and through forests. Finally they got there.
P11	They found Inyang under the tree with his herd of cows in the field. Although the cows looked healthy,  Inyang wasn't. He got thin and had empty stomach.
P12	The cows had eaten to their capacity. The green grass was fresh. The cows mooed and enjoyed this wonderful grassland.
P13	Meanwhile,  after greetings Inyang was fed with the delicious and appetizing foods his parents carried for him. He enjoyed his meal as the parents admired the grassland in the horizon.
P14	His father went for the cows. He was pleased of his son and how a realy shepherd he was.
P15	Inyang ate enough and drank too. His stomach was no longer empty but full. He was happy of how his parents responded quickly for his help.
P16	The parents then convinced Inyang to come back home. They told him how the rains had started falling at home. Inyang hesitantly accepted to go back. He assembled his cows and tarted the journey.
P17	In his heart and mind,  Inyang was grateful to the bird for saving his life too.
