page_text:

P1	High above the ground was the kingdom of light. It was ruled by two shiny creatures named Sun and his Queen, Moon. @@They had many beautiful looking servants called stars.
P2	Sun and Moon were married but after they quarreled, they separated.@@They stayed apart for so long that Sun became too hot and Moon very cold.
P3	Moon's birthday came. Everyone was busy preparing for the celebration. @@The skies were decorated beautifully for Moon's birthday celebration.
P4	Moon wrote a letter inviting Sun to her birthday party . @@Sun turned down the invitation.
P5	Although Moon believed that Sun still loved her, she did not hear from him. Moon was very sad.@@She cried and could not eat. She put down her crown. She threw her golden scepter away. @@Even the stars could not comfort her.
P6	When Sun learned about Moon's condition, he was sad. @@He promised to attend her birthday party.
P7	Moon was happy. She wiped her tears and asked the stars to prepare well. Everything was ready. @@Moon, sat smiling like the Queen she was, waiting for Sun.
P8	Sun arrived and Moon rushed out to welcome him. She hugged Sun. @@Moon began to melt. She fell to the ground screaming for help.
P9	Suddenly, darkness covered the area where Moon fell. @@Sun moved away and the kingdom was divided.
P10	Moon went away with all the stars. @@She rules them during the night as gentle Queen.
P11	Sun is still the King of Daylight. @@Sometimes he is angry, shooting his rays at human beings and animals.
