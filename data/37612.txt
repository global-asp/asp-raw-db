P1	One day, mummy and Saeed went in a trip to the beach.
P2	On the beach, a big wave rose. Saeed loved it and said:" Mummy there should be a giant whale, that paddled by it's super giant tale, and rose that wave" .
P3	Mummy smiled and said: what will you tell the whale?@Saeed said:" Whaley ! Whaley ! Paddle your tale again and again. To make the sea waves, so the surfers can surfe. The the sea is boring without waves!".
P4	Mummy told Saeed: "how about having a walk on the beach?".On their walk, a nice wind blew at their cheecks.
P5	Saeed said: "There should be a big bird which is flapping it's wings to fly. It sent us this breeze". Mummy smiled and said: what do you want to say to the bird?Saeed said: "Birdy! Birdy! Flap your wings, to send us winds".
P6	Suddenly a cloud covered the sunlight and Saeed said:" Mummy look! The sun is wearing a white coat. Mr. Sun, can you please take off your coat, to see your light? "
P7	And when the cloud sent some  rain drops on Saeed and mummy, he said:" There might be a wet poppy shaking his body to get red of the water! The funny poppy splashed us with his water! Shake shake poppy you are so funny" .
P8	Saeed felt the warm sand of the beach by his feet and said: " I think that the sand is made of the wealthy king's golden coins, because the sand is shiny like gold".
P9	Now can you imagine, Who made the waves? How did the winds blow? Who covered the sunlight?how did the raindrops fall? And what is the sand made of?
