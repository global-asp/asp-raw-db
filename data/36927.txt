desc:	The family had to move because dad got a new job

page_text:

P1	There was a boy by the name Jabu, Jabu lived a happy life with his parents and two sisters. They lived in a nice neighbourhood and went to the best schools. Jabu was the captain of his soccer team. He was a popular boy and everyone in school knew who he was. He enjoyed the attention.
P2	His dad finally landed his dream job which meant that the family would live an even better life because they would have more money and it's the job that his father always wanted.
P3	Everyone was excited for dad's new jobs except Jabu. Jabu knew that dad, getting his dream job would mean that they would have to relocate.
P4	They eventually moved. Jabu and his siblings were all at the new school and Jabu hated every minute of it. Being the new kid wasn't fun at all for Jabu.  After a month of their arrival, everything about Jabu changed, he no longer played soccer and hardly ever went out. Jabu hated school.
P5	His father noticed a change in Jabu's behaviour, so he sat him down and they had a lengthy conversation and Jabu told him all about the bully at school.
P6	The next day Jabu and his father spoke to the school principal regarding the student who is bullying kids, Jason the school bully was called into the principal's office along with his parents.
P7	Jason was reprimanded and his parents seeked counselling for him. Jason apologised to Jabu and promised to be a better person. Since then no bullying ever took place at that school again, Jabu and Jason became best friends.
