P1	Hi my name is gabby and here is something you don't know about my teachers @When it's just me left waiting for my parents to pick me up at waiting area i  see the strangest things like My principal signing 25 papers within 0,5 seconds
P2	And My english teacher is talking to a bunch of aliens in another language !@Oh and my Music  teacher Oh she is playing the piano in the sky and still drifting off right now and my Library teacher is busy talking to books@ Last but not least my ns teacher is busy spinning up a tornado in the classroom and I mean an actual one.
P3	Maybe it is in my head but my teachers do the weirdest things  when they think everyone is gone. Oh there is my mom, "mom! Mom!You won't believe what happened just  now!".
P4	Bye see you next Time readers
