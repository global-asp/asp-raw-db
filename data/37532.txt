page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a little girl named Owethu who was the youngest and smartest of her friends. Owethu loved to spend some time with her friends even though sometimes her friends would run away from her and hide from her.
P2	Owethu thought it was a game and enjoyed running around looking for them, until one day she realised that they were hiding because they did not want to play with her. This made Owethu wry sad but her friends did not care they just laughed.
P3	Owethu decided to walk away from them and go home. She spent days, then weeks and then months at home without going to see her friends. When her friends noticed that she was no longer coming to look for them,
P4	They realized that they were lonely and bored without her and that made them sad, so they decided to go visit her and apologize for being mean to her. When they got to her home, she welcomed them with a smile.
P5	One of the friends said “we are so sorry for being mean to you”, the other one said “we were just jealous because you are so smart and you are always happy, please forgive us and with us again”. Owethu smiled and said I forgive you.
P6	She then said I am only smart because I read my books everyday and I am happy because I enjoy playing with you my friends. They all laughed and hugged each other and one of them said, “we should read our books and have fun together always.”
