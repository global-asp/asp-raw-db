P2	We can measure 8 equal parts on the jug.@@We can use a piece of string to measure.@@Cut the string to the same length as the height of the juice in the jug.
P3	Fold the string into 8 equal parts.@@Mark the equal parts on the jug.@@Then we are ready to pour 8 equal amounts of juice.
P4	We share the lemon juice.@@When it is finished, we want to drink more!@@How do you make lemon juice?
P5	Lemon juice@@water – 7 cups@sugar – 2 cups@juice from lemons – 1 cup@@You will need to squeeze about 7 ripe lemons.@@Use a big jug or 2 litre bottle to mix ingredients.
