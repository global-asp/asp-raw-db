page_text:

P1	It was on Saturday morning. The dew on the grass shone brightly like broken pieces of a mirror exposed to direct sunlight. Suddenly, Stanley's truck zoomed past us. He was a good friend of ours. he worked as a driver in a delivery company.
P2	We waved at him as he talked to someone on the phone. We continued walking briskly to the shopping centre. As we walked along the tarmac, we saw Ashley's car. Ashley was also a good friend of ours. We waved at her.
P3	She waved back as she zoomed past us. We had hardly reached at the shopping center when we heard a loud screeching sound. We hurriedly ran towards the direction it was coming from.
P4	We were greatly astonished by what we saw. Stanley's truck was driving at a neck-breaking speed that could ashame a cheetah. It lost control and collided into Ashley's car which was coming from the other direction.
P5	By good luck a police vehicle on patrol came to the scene. He hurriedly called for an ambulance. Within a thrush of a lamb's tail, the ambulance, the rescue team and another police vehicle arrived at the scene.
P6	Stanley was rushed to the hospital while Ashley who was not badly injured, was given first aid.
P7	The rescue team towed both vehicles to the garage for fixing. My sister and I were left mouths wide agape and embarked on our journey back home to narrate the story.
P8	We rushed back home to inform Stanley's family that he was involved in a tragic accident and was taken to the nearest hospital by an ambulance. His family was shocked beyond words and they hurriedly went to the hospital to see him.
