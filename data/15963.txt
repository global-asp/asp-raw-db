desc:	Zumo wants to marry Zahara

page_text:

P1	Mqanduli is a beautiful place close to Mthatha and has rigid buildings. There are many streets and we have many places to go in Mthatha.
P2	Zuma has a big head and long moustache. He has big eyes. Zuma is not beautiful,  he is old. When you look at Zuma you see a killer.
P3	Zuma wanted to ask Zahara to marry him,  but he did not know how he could talk to her. He decided to go to Zahara's house and talk with her.
P4	Zuma asked Zahara to marry him. Zahara said,  "No! I can't marry you because you are too old and I have my own boyfriend called Amaza. I will marry him."
P5	Zuma went to the traditional healer for medicine that would make Zahara marry him. The traditional healer said,  "I love Zahara and Amaza is the one who will marry her. So I can't do that."
P6	Zuma didn't get medicine and he was so sad and angry because he loved Zahara too much.
P7	Zahara didn't marry Zuma. And she never will.
