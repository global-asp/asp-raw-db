P1	One day in a small village there was a family. Mr and Mrs Alu. Who had eight children.Mr Alu was a farmer and Mrs Alu was a housewife.@The only thing in their way was money. They had no money, therefore food was also impossible.
P2	They had not eaten for a week, and they were complaining to their parents.@Until they got an idea to go to the forest to search for food on trees.
P3	Everyone in the town knew of snakes on that tree. But they had no option. No one even Mr. Alu volunteered. Only Simi the last born volunteered
P4	Her bravery was amazing. When she went to the tree she found gold on the tree. The gold was hidden there and protected by using snakes to scare people. Simi grabbed it and gave it to her parents
P5	From that day they lived happily ever after.
