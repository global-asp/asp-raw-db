desc:	I am home due to the pandemic in 2020. I miss looking out of my office window to this view that connects me to my youth.

page_text:

P1	From my window, this is my view daily. The refreshing greenery from the boys school grounds. It is always fulfilling to see the boys in the sports grounds playing or just watching them in their school uniform. It brings back good memories
P2	Back in the days I wore a uniform, my school was very strict about the uniform, I was taught  it is the image of the school and all times must represent my school well. I guess this teaching is still valid in schools today.
P3	I have missed this view for a while. It is April 2020, our country has come to a halt.  A Lockdown. The world is under attack from a virus. No work, no school, no watching play in the open fields. I am learning to appreciate life more.
P4	I am not looking out of my office window. I am not allowed anywhere near there, I miss all this. The world has been under attack from a pandemic. This is so strange to me, to us. To survive we must play by the rules. That's it.
P5	I am looking forward to the day I will be free, free from the pandemic. I am anxious what the world will be like. Will the school boys have to wear masks over their mouths? Will my picture change? All I can do is wait and see.
