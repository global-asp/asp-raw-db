P2	This mat was special. It was made of palm leaves in different colours.
P3	The land around Asiimwe's home was dry and hot.@@There were many snakes, spiders and scorpions, but they didn't harm her.
P4	According to her mother, Asiimwe's mat protected her.
P5	Asiimwe started going to the local well. She also knew her grandmother's home and loved visiting her.
P6	By bad luck, one day Asiimwe got lost on her way to her grandmother's home.
P7	She sat down under a musisa tree and waited for help. While waiting, she fell asleep.
P8	She started dreaming of a woman who looked like her grandmother. She was very happy.
P9	When she woke up, she saw a bird and heard it calling her, "Asiimwe, Asiimwe, wake up and go home."
P10	The bird flew while dropping a piece of mat that looked like Asiimwe's mat. @@Asiimwe followed the bird.
