page_text:

P1	What will school be like today?@@I can't wait to see my friends!@@How will we make up the lessons we missed?
P2	When lockdown started, I was afraid.@@Mum couldn't go to work.@@There wasn't enough money to buy food.
P3	Mum and Dad were arguing too much!@@And you and I were fighting a lot, too.
P4	Mr. Khumalo was very sick. I was afraid Dad would get sick, too.@@We prayed for them and God helped them.@@And then God provided us with food!
P5	Lord Jesus,@Please help our family.@@Please be with all our friends and help them, too.@@Thank you for loving us and hearing our prayers. Amen.
P6	"God is our strong refuge; he is truly our helper in times of trouble."@@Psalm 46:1
