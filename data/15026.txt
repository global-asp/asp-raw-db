page_text:

P1	My hand feeds me day and night My hand keeps me clean all the time My hand is the centre of infections,  touching everything My hand touches faeces as I ease myself My hand brings food contaminated by flies into my mouth Making my stomach grumble the whole night My hand gives me sleepless nights of pain My hand is the cause of my death.
