page_text:

P1	There was a rich cunning man called Madola. He hired people who worked hard but he did not pay them their wages.
P2	Dande was 11 years old. He went to Madola for work so he could buy medicine for his grandmother. Madola hired Dande to graze his animals.
P3	At the end of the month,  Dande went for his pay. The cunning Madola said,  "Go home and come back tomorrow for your pay."
P4	Dande arrived early at Madola's home expecting to be paid. Madola said,  "Why! Are you a student? Why so early? Is this a school?"
P5	Madola took Dande away from other workers. He said,  "I will pay you only if you bring me a gourd of honey."
P6	Dande thought,  "I need the money for grandmother's medicine." He ran to the forest and placed two gourds beneath a bee-hive to fill up.
P7	While Dande wondered how to punish Madola,  a small black poisonous snake entered one of the gourds unnoticed. Afterwards,  Dande sealed the gourds and left.
P8	Dande gave Madola one gourd expecting his pay. After tasting,  Madola said,  "Bring me another gourd and I will pay you." Dande ran for it.
P9	Dande brought the second gourd. He gave it to Madola saying,  "Here is another gourd of sweet honey like the last one. Pay me now."
P10	Madola took the gourd but said in a cunning way,  "There is no pay today. Wait for the end of the year." Dande was angry.
P11	Madola wanted to eat the honey. He put his finger in the gourd and was bitten. He cried,  "I'm bitten! Help!" The snake disappeared unnoticed.
P12	All the workers ran away not knowing what had happened to their employer. A short while later,  an ambulance arrived to take Madola to hospital.
