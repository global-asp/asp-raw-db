P1	Long ago there lived a cow called Bora. One day her owner got seriously sick, told Bora to take care of her kids and died.
P2	The husband of the woman who died married another woman.
P3	The woman gave her own kid much food. However, she gave her stepchildren only enjera.
P4	Her kid got thinner and thinner, but her stepchildren got fatter and fatter. She felt bad and wanted to know the reason.
P5	She sent her kid to see hiding what her stepchildren do and the girl listened and saw what they did with Bora.
P6	She got closer to the cow and asked, "Bora, please give me what Mom told you."
P7	Then Bora's manure became bread and its urine milk. When the girl tasted the 'bread' it tasted bitter, and the 'milk' too.
P8	The girl told her mother what she saw and did. The mother concluded that was the reason why her stepchildren got fat.
P9	The kids kept getting fat. Then the woman thought to do something about the cow.
P10	One day she told her family that she got sick. She added she would die if she didn't eat Bora's meat.
P11	The kids who heard this hid Bora and brought another cow.
P12	They killed the new cow
P13	When the woman heard that the cow had been sloughtered, she said she recoverd.
P14	The woman learned that the kids were getting bigger.
P15	"I am not giving them food. Why are they getting bigger?" she asked.
P16	One day she followed the children. But she fell down and died. And the kids lived happily ever after.
