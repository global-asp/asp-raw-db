P1	"SWOOSH!" With a huge fright, Thobekile looked up. "What on earth is that sound?" she said to herself. As she lifts her head, her big, brown eyes catch an enormous bird like figure. She could not take her eyes off of this strange object."
P2	"Why is a bird making such a weird sound?" Thobe thought. She squinted her eyes a little, and suddenly realized "This is not a bird, this is the flying car Muzi told me about. I can't believe I FINALLY get to see one," she yelled excitedly.
P3	As she stood, staring up at the wide, blue sky, she thought about all the adventures she would go on one day. "I have the prettiest, purple dress I could wear for my first trip in the flying car. I can just imagine how I will look."
P4	"We'd be off to the beach, I could take my new swimming costume with," Thobe said excitedly, while she jumped with joy! As she stood there, she closed her eyes and imagined being in the cool water.@I could take all my friends, even Muzi.
P5	Just then, she opened her eyes and noticed the flying car had disappeared. "I have to tell Muzi about it," she screamed. As she ran towards Aunty Noni's house, she yelled "Muzi, Muzi! You will not believe what I just saw."
P6	Muzi came running towards Thobekile. "What's the matter?" he asked. "I saw a flying car!" she screamed, as her eyes widened. Muzi laughed. "It's not a flying car, Thobe. It's an aeroplane."
