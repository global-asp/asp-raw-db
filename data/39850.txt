page_text:

P1	There she was, in the kitchen, with fear in her eyes, Mrs Britton told herself to make the most delicious rabbit pie to share with her class. She cooked, and cooked, and even more cooking until finally... the masterpiece was made.
P2	The rabbit pie,was so delicious that everyone would want it (including those nasty picky eaters who won't take a single bite at something that looks off). But a live rabbit passed the woods and when it passed Mrs britton, she thought.....
P3	To herself, " Why don't I make another rabbit pie to eat all by myself?" Then she got out her gun and chased down the rabbit. But before she did that, she took her rabbit pie and put it on the shelf to cool. She went into full hunting mode.
P4	Chapter 2: The escape@@The rabbit ran fast as he could but had no match for the lady. She put a  trap with food inside. The bunny went in and was sent to bunny prison where he would get slaughtered by the lady and turned into bunny pie.
P5	The bunny knew how to escape. First he turned one of the carrots in the jail and chewed it down to a carrot key but thre was one prombem. The cage could only be opened from the outside, and he didn't have long enough arms to reach.
P6	"Ha!" Mrs Britton cried. You will never be able to escape! Tomorrow is your slaughter day. So you should say your goodbyes. Awww!" She said but not in the cuute type. The mean type of one you use to point out small and trapped kind. "Bye!".
P7	So their she went happy with a smirk on her face. Don't worry, the rabbit was smirking too because he had something else planned. The bunny stretched out his teeth with hold of the food key and escaped. He ran as his little legs could run.
