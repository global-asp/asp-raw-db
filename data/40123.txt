page_text:

P1	It was my tenth birthday. After a game of football with my friends at home, I went and discussed with my parents excitedly about a suitable birthday gift.
P2	I returned to play with my friends. Suddenly Juma hit my head hard with the ball. It felt very painful and I started crying loudly. My parents were very startled to hear me cry and after learning what had happened, they comforted me.
P3	I was very annoyed because my parents did not punish Juma and so I ran away from home. I went to the forest and hid up a very big tree. It was tough for me to climb it but I strived until I got up there.
P4	My parents followed me to the forest and saw where I had hidden. They persuaded me to come down but i refused. My mother left to go and call my best friend Lola.
P5	She came and reminded me it is important to obey my parents and so she beseeched me to come down.
P6	Lola was very happy that I had heeded to her advise. She begged me to forgive Juma. We walked back as we chatted along happily.
P7	When we got home we found many people waiting for us. My parents, friends and neighbours had organised a suprise birthday party for me. I apologized to everyone for my actions.
P8	I received many gifts. Among them was a beautiful purple dress that my parents had bought for me. It was my best birthday ever.
