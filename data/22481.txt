P3	If you walk down the red clay road and
pass the small white church, you will
come to a blue house with a red roof
and a green door.
P4	Here lives Thembi, her brother, Bongani, and
their Gogo.
P5	Gogo is in the kitchen, cooking dinner. From
the window she can see Bongani and other
children playing. But where is Thembi?
P6	Gogo takes off her apron and goes
to look for her granddaughter.
P7	Gogo finds Thembi sitting
under the big tree, playing
with her favorite doll.
P8	Gogo asks Thembi, "Why are you sitting here, all alone?" "Oh," replies Thembi. "The other children don't want to play with me."
P9	At the clinic, they meet Mr. Ntuli. He asks Thembi to
cover one eye with her hand and tell him what she
sees on the chart.
P10	"What about playing with your friend Sizani?" asks Gogo. "Sizani is mad at me," replies Thembi. "She said that last week she waved to me and I ignored her. Gogo, I really didn't see her."
P11	"What about playing with your brother?" asks Gogo.
"Bongani doesn't like to play with me," sighs Thembi. "He says that every time he kicks the ball to me, I miss it."
P12	"But aren't you lonely?" asks Gogo. "Oh no," replies Thembi. "I love sitting here, listening to the tree sing its beautiful songs. Listen, can't you hear it?"
P13	Gogo listens and then looks up into the tree and sees a beautiful kingfisher, a cuckoo, and a robin, all singing their songs.
P14	Gogo remembered Thembi's teacher telling her that
Thembi struggles to see what she writes on the chalkboard. So, early the next morning, Gogo and
Thembi walk to the local clinic.
P15	At the clinic, they meet Mr. Ntuli. He asks Thembi to
cover one eye with her hand and tell him what she
sees on the chart.
P16	Thembi looks and looks and says, "I can see
something, but I am not sure what it is."
P17	Mr. Ntuli puts a metal frame on Thembi's nose.
Then, he slides a round glass into the frame and
asks Thembi, "Now, what can you see?"
P18	"I can see," shouts Thembi. "I can see the letter E and F and P and even the little letters, P, Z, and D." "That's perfect," says Mr. Ntuli. "All you need are spectacles, and you will see just fine."
P19	The nurse takes Thembi and Gogo to another room
where there are many shelves filled with spectacles of all sizes and colours. Thembi chooses the bright red frames. "A good choice," says Gogo.
P20	After one week, Thembi and Gogo return to Mr. Ntuli's office and Thembi tries her new spectacles.
As she looks out the window she shouts, "Gogo. I see people and a small dog, and a black bird on top
of that house."
P21	"Thembi," says Mr. Ntuli, "I want you to promise me that you will wear your spectacles every day." "Oh yes," replies Thembi. "I promise. I promise. I love my spectacles and all the wonderful things I can see."
P22	As Gogo and Thembi walk home, Thembi sees Sizani
on the other side of the road. "Hi, Sizani," Thembi
shouts and waves. Sizani smiles and waves back.
P23	Just as Gogo and Thembi reach their house, they meet some of Thembi's friends. "Oh Thembi, I love your spectacles," says one girl. "They make you look very smart," comments one of the boys. "Maybe I also need spectacles?" remarks another.
P24	All of a sudden, a ball comes rolling towards Thembi.
Thembi quickly kicks the ball back to her brother. "Do you want to play?" asks Bongani. "Yes," she replies. "But first I have something very important to do."
P25	Thembi walks behind the house and stands under the large tree. As she looks up, she can see the kingfisher, the cuckoo and the robin.
P26	She puts her arms around the tree and with a big smile, says, "Thank you tree. Thank you for singing such beautiful songs to me."
P27	Author Kenneth Youngstein has spent forty years developing educational programs for healthcare professionals and patients throughout the world.
