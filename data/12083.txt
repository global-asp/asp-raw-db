desc:	Ebei and his mother are waiting for the big blue bus to take them to town.

page_text:

P1	There was only one bus in Ebei's village. It was big and blue. It was very noisy.
P2	"Tomorrow we will go to town," said Ebei's mother.  "We will buy your school uniform."
P3	Ebei was very excited. They would travel in the big blue bus. He could not sleep that night.
P4	When his mother came to wake him,  Ebei was already dressed.
P5	Ebei and his mother walked to the bus stop. They waited for the big blue bus. But the bus did not come.
P6	Other people arrived at the bus stop. They complained because the bus was late. "Where is the bus?" they asked.
P7	Ebei was worried. "We will not be able to go to town," he thought. "I will not be able to get my uniform."
P8	Some people gave up and went home. Ebei cried. He did not want to go. "We will wait a bit longer," said his mother.
P9	Suddenly,  they heard a noise.  They saw dust in the air. The bus was coming!
P10	But this bus was not blue. It was not big. It was red and small. The people did not want to get in this bus.
P11	"Get in! Get in!" shouted the driver. "We are very late today," he called.
P12	Ebei and his mother got in first. Soon everyone else got in the small red bus.
P13	Ebei looked out the window. He saw more people at the bus stop.
P14	Even more people were running to catch the bus. But they were too late. The red bus was full. It left for town.
P15	"Where is the big blue bus?" asked Ebei's mother. "It broke down," replied the driver. "We are fixing it. It will come tomorrow."
P16	Ebei did not care about the colour of the bus. He did not care about the size. This bus was going to town!
