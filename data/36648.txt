page_text:

P1	My friend and I used to play football in the village. @@Our team was called New Faces.
P2	One day, we went to play against a team called The Brothers. @@We were sure we would win the game.
P3	We did not know that The Brothers was a very experienced team.
P4	During the first half, New Faces scored one goal.@@ The Brothers had nil.
P5	During the second half, things changed very quickly. @@The Brothers scored four goals! @@We didn't score any.
P6	We began playing rough against The Brothers. @@Still, we scored no more goals.
P7	We lost the game! @@I was so disappointed.
P8	From that day, I learned two things.@@Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win.
