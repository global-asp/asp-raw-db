page_text:

P1	Tiny shoot begins to show,  A tiny plant begins to grow.
P2	Reaching higher towards the sun,  Reaching higher until it's done.
P3	Now it's a big tree,  leafy and green,  Spreading it's branches so it can be seen.
P4	The branches are strong now,  sturdy and steady,  The tree needs some fruit now,  the branches are ready.
P5	First comes the flowers,  then come the bees,  Then after the bees come the fruit on the trees.
P6	The mangoes are picked by my fumbling hands,  And put into big baskets to eat or make jams.
P7	This juicy,  red mango looks delicious and fresh,  Inside of the skin is bright yellow flesh.
P8	Just one bite to taste it,  sweet,  juicy,  cool,  That one little taste is making me drool!
P9	My mango is finished,  I ate it so fast,  I must get another and it won't be my last!
