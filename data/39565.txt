P1	In Aniri village, there was a lion who ruled over the village.  @@In the village also lived Tortoise who was hard-working. He had two wives and four children.
P2	One day, Tortoise was working on his farm. He heard a voice in the bush saying, "Pack those yams." @@He tried to run to where the voice came from. He was too slow. @@The thieves made away with the yams.
P3	Tortoise was sad because he could not catch the thieves. @@He told himself, "A thief has ninety-nine days. One day is for the owner!"
P4	At the end of the day's work, Tortoise went back home. @@He immediately went to the king's palace to report the theft.
P5	The king and his cabinet made plans on how to capture the thieves.
P6	Another day, Tortoise went to the farm.@@He heard the same voice saying, "Let's go, let's go!"
P7	Tortoise shouted loudly, "Thieves oh, thieves oh!"  @The king had ordered the villagers to hide in the bush nearby. They all came out. @@They saw that it was the hyenas. The thieves were taken to the king.
P8	The king sent them away from the kingdom. They had no yams to eat. @@That is why hyenas eat leftovers of what other animals eat.
