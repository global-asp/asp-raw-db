page_text:

P1	Nora went to school one Monday morning. There had been a donation of books at her school during the weekend. They were not so many so each classroom got a few of them. @@When reading time came, the books were not enough for all learners in her class. They would have to take turns to read.
P2	So on the first day, some learners got the books and some did not. Those who did not get a book would read the following day. @@Nora wanted to read the new book so much that she could not wait. She went to her teacher and told her that she would love to read the book on the first day. @@The teacher told her she would have to wait for her turn the following day because there were not enough books.
P3	Nora did not understand this so she was very sad as she went back to her seat. @@At home she asked her parents why the school did not have enough books. Her parents told her that the school could not afford to buy books for every learner.
P4	When the weekend came, Nora had a brilliant idea. She would borrow her father's guitar and play it in the town square. People would put donations in her tin. @@Her parents thought it was a good idea. Nora's father accompanied her to the town square. He sat on a bench while Nora played the guitar.
P5	She played and played and played, all morning and all afternoon. People smiled at her as they passed by but, none of them stopped. @@Her father finally came and told her she would try again the next day. Perhaps she would have better luck then.@@Nora started crying on their way home.
P6	An elderly couple who were walking their dog saw them and stopped them. They asked what the matter was.@@A sobbing Nora told them what had happened. Then the elderly couple asked her to play the guitar for them, which she did. @@They promised her that for her guitar playing services they would donate books at her school.
P7	The next day, Nora went to school as usual. When they gathered for the morning session, the teacher announced that Nora had done fundraising for books. @@Every learner would have their own copy from then on.
