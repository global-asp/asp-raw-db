P1	One day, our class went to visit Mr Kieru's factory, before we got there we had different expectations. When we got to Mr.Kieru's factory, we found him and his employees making some unique products. These were millet Kashata.
P2	He told us of how he started his factory.  One day Mr. Kieru had left his town of Embu County in Kenya for Japan for greener pastures. He did not take long. When he came back to his town he had a lot of knowledge and ideas from Japan.
P3	In the traditional days, people use to grid millet flour to make porridge and ugali. During those days, farmers used to plant millet in plenty as it was among their main food crop.But Mr. Kieru had a different idea.
P4	On his return from Japan Mr. Kieru had bought a big and unique machine which he uses to make millet Kashata and pops. He took us through the whole process which he started by putting on a clean overall which included a headgear.
P5	Mr.Kieru then introduced us in to making the millet Kashata. After one hour he had finished making the millet Kashata which he flavoured using honey. When it was ready he gave us each a piece to taste.
P6	Pupils and our class teacher were very happy and we all agreed it was very unique and tasty. Some pupils and our teacher even bought some to take to their families back at home. Mr. kieru was the first person in Kenya to make millet Kashata
P7	When we got back to school we told our headteacher about the visit and she promised to organize with Mr Kieru on the day to take the other pupils to the factory. It was an educative trip that tought us on different uses of millet.
