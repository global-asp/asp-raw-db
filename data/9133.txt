page_text:

P1	A long time ago,  in the village of Nyamani,  there lived a man known as Kiundu. Kiundu liked to eat very much. He especially liked to eat meat.
P2	One day,  the chief of the village invited all the villagers to his son's wedding.
P3	Then Kiundu heard people talking about another wedding party. It was in a nearby village called Katumbi.  "Two parties on the same day!" Kiundu thought.
P4	"I must attend both parties," Kiundu said to himself. "I will first walk to Katumbi and then come back to Nyamani."
P5	Kiundu woke up early in the morning and walked to Katumbi village. When he arrived he saw that the cooks were still preparing the food. "I will go back to Nyamani and return here later," Kiundu decided.
P6	Kiundu walked back to Nyamani hoping to find the meat ready. He was now hungry. But when he arrived,  people there were also still preparing the food.
P7	"When I left Katumbi they were starting to cook," he thought. "The food must be ready now." So Kiundu walked back to Katumbi. He was now very hungry.
P8	By the time Kiundu got to Katumbi,  people had already eaten.  Guests were giving presents to the bride and the groom. Kiundu did not have a gift to give. He only wanted to eat.
P9	Kiundu was most disappointed about missing the food. He decided to walk back to Nyamani village. He was hungry and tired and walked very slowly.
P10	When he arrived at Nyamani village,  people were singing and dancing. They had already eaten all the food!
P11	When he heard that there was no food,  Kiundu fainted. He had missed meat from both parties. When he recovered,  he got some porridge in a small cup!
P12	Kiundu walked home again,  still hungry.
