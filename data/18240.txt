page_text:

P1	There was a boy named Mike. Mike was six years old. Mike was crying because he couldn't go for Fred's birthday party without his shoes.
P2	Mike's mum shouted at him for misplacing his new shoes and said that he wouldn't leave unless he found his shoes. He searched and searched but only found the two left legs of different shoes.
P3	Mike saw a floating man and asked who he was. "I am a genie" he said "Can I get a wish then?" Mike asked "Yes,  but be careful what you wish for" He warned. Mike wished for two left legs so that he could wear the shoes and go for the party.
