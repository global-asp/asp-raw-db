page_text:

P1	Long time ago,  there were four little friends namely: Joel, Jonah, Job and Jacob.
P2	They were studying at Busolwe primary school.
P3	The boys used to go to school with out taking tea.
P4	They used to feel sleepy at school all the because of hunger.
P5	One day,  they decided to go to to a nearby trading center called gampe and look for something to eat.
P6	After crossing to a nearby trading center,  they saw a bigger banana bunch in a box at the veranda.
P7	The boys whispered at each other hahahaaaaa. We have been very hungry but,  said Jonah.
P8	All ran to the veranda. Picked up some bananas from the box,  smiled and started eating. Do you now what they forgot to do?
P9	While eating,  the owner of the bananas came walking in bigger strides. ''Who has given you my bananas?'' asked the man.
P10	As soon as they heard that voice,  the boys ran as fast as they could and hid somewhere. They said to each other that no laughing,  no coughing and no talking.
P11	The owner of the bananas made an alarm,  ''wulululululua,  here are the thieves.
P12	The boys were arrested,  taken to school,  called their parents,  the teachers,  and the school children to gather.
P13	The boys were given a punishment. Each got some ten strokes and repented not to steal anything again.
