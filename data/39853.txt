page_text:

P1	Friday is market day in Isiolo town. It was Friday morning, and my mother and I went to the market. @@l was as happy because my mother was going to buy me new clothes that I had requested a month before.
P2	When we arrived at the market, we saw many people walking around buying things they needed. @@My mum told me to give her the hand bag for her to pay for a dress I had chosen.
P3	After two minutes, we saw a police car coming through the market gate. @@As it slowed down, people started hiding themselves in the sacks because they were afraid of the police officers.
P4	When the police officers came out of the car, everyone started  running away from the market without knowing where they were going to. @@My mother and I ran as fast as our feeble legs could carry us looking for a place to hide.
P5	As people were running, we heard someone screaming, "Help me!" The police officers had caught someone and taken him to the car. @@We watched hopelessly from our hiding spot as the police officers took more people without masks to the car.
P6	After the police car left, my mother called my uncle to come and take us home on his motorbike. @@My mother said, "We should not forget to carry masks next time."
