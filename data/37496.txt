page_text:

P1	Every morning I wash my face.
P2	I brush my teeth with toothpaste.
P3	I comb my hair.
P4	I take  a shower.
P5	I wash my body with soap.
P6	I wear clean clothes.
P7	When I go outside I wear shoes.
P8	I wash my hands with soap and clean water...
P9	...after I go to the toilet...
P10	….before I eat...
P11	….and after playing outside.
P12	I brush my teeth again before I go to bed.
P13	I like to smell clean...
P14	and look clean!
