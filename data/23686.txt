page_text:

P1	In a lakeside village, there lived a young girl. 

Her name was Atieno.
P2	Atieno's father was a famous fisherman. He had his own little fishing canoe. 

Atieno enjoyed going fishing with her father.
P3	Atieno loved to watch the boys play football. 

"Let me play with you," she begged them one day. 

The boys laughed at her, "Go and play hide and seek with girls. "
P4	Girls said to Atieno, "Your legs are too long." Atieno was sad. 

Each morning, Atieno danced alone with the sun.

The sun became her friend.
P5	One day, the sun did not rise. Cocks did not crow, birds did not sing and children did not go to school. Even her father did not go fishing.

Atieno was sad. "Where is my friend, the sun? Why is it so dark today?"
P6	Atieno went to the other children to tell them how sad she was. But they laughed at her, "Perhaps your friend the sun, is dead. Or perhaps it ran away from you."

Atieno said, "The sun is my friend. It cannot die."
P7	Atieno was so sad that she ran to the house. She kicked her brother's ball very hard.
P8	Atieno thought, "I will play with this ball until my friend, the sun returns." 

She picked up the ball and ran out with it.
P9	When Atieno reached outside, she put the ball on the ground. She thought, "I can play just like them." 

She kicked the ball hard. It went up and up into the cloudy sky.
P10	As everybody stared up, the ball disappeared into the thick clouds. 

There was total silence.
P11	Suddenly, the thick clouds cleared and the sun appeared. Life returned to the lakeside village once again. 

Everybody prepared to do what they always did.
P12	Atieno could not believe that she had brought the sun back to the village. But most of all, the sun was back in her life. 

She told the children, "My friend, the sun is back!"
