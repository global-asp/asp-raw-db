page_text:

P1	Once Upon A Time, in a land far away, there lived an absolutely BEAUTIFUL Queen with her lovely little princess My'zhai.
P2	They lived in a HUGE castle with lots of land that stretched far and wide with plenty of room to roam and run around all through out the day.
P3	One day, Queen Mommy and Princess My'zhai decided they wanted to go out into the forest and have a picnic together and it would be just the two of them.
P4	On the way into the forest, Queen Mommy and Princess My'zhai walked down the path, holding hands singing a happy toon. All of a sudden, a little Bush next to them started to shake uncontrollably and both ladies were REALLY scared.
P5	Princess My'zhai was sooo scared, she let go of her mommy's hand and climbed up a tree alllll the way to the top.
P6	Queen mommy had to think fast. The only thing the queen could do was to first go over to th bushes to get rid of whatever made her baby princess go up a tree. To both of their surprise, what jumped out the bush...
P7	Was a little baby monkey! The queen and the princess both started to laugh because they were so scared before.  They both could tell the little monkey was hungry, so they decided to give the monkey a banana from the basket of food they had.
P8	The monkey was so happy and so nice,  that Queen mommy and Princess My'zhai decided to let the monkey join them on their walk.
P9	The three continued on their journey for what seemed like forever, but it was a beautiful sunny day and they finally found the perfect spot to lay under a shady tree and spread out the blanket for the lovely picnic they were about to have.
P10	In the end, Princess My'zhai, Queen mommy and the little monkey all ate good food and laughed all day until the stars decided to come out and bless the sky and watch over the three as they looked up and fell asleep.
