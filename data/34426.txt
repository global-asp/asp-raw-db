page_text:

P1	In a far away town, there was a smart and expensive shoe shop. @@This is the town in which I was born.
P2	Many people came to this shoe shop, but few could afford to buy the fancy footwear. @@One day, a rich man with big feet visited the shop.
P3	He put his money on the shop counter. @@Then, with his hands in his pockets, he walked up and down looking at the shoes.
P4	As he came closer, I held my breath and froze.@@He stretched out his hands and grabbed me.@@He sat down and put me on his feet.
P5	He had huge feet, and the smell nearly suffocated me! @@I was packed into a box.@@We drove home, and he put me in a cupboard.
P6	He wore me every day.@@I made him smart and he walked with confidence. @@I had a hard life. He was always lazy about washing his feet.
P7	In return, sometimes I pinched him, making him limp.@@Eventually, I became old and broken, with scars and cracks.@@He put me outside, next to the rubbish bin.
P8	Someone picked me up for recycling, and took me to a leather workshop.@@At the workshop I was made into a shiny new wallet!@@I began a new life.
