page_text:

P1	My name is Cliche Wessels and i am 11 years of age. Ever since i started school i barely had any friends. I was more of a introvert and very dedicated to my school work.
P2	Since the beginning of of my grade 6 year, I noticed a new girl in my class her name was Micheala.
P3	From what I could pick up she was very smart, polite and friendly. Unlike me she was a extrovert.
P4	Micheala always approached me asking how i´m doing?, after a few days it became a norm and soon after a how you was only a start of many other conversations.
P5	Micheala told me about her family,where she comes from, her previous school and the friends that she had.
P6	Micheala almost explained her whole life to me, from that i could pick up that she was from a very well off and wonderful family, that always supports her in everything that she does. Sometimes i wish i could have a family like that
P7	As time passed me and Micheala became extremely close. We than started meeting each others family.
P8	I started calling her my best friend as we started doing everything together,from homework to even church on Sundays.
P9	I became so close to her that whatever happened in my life i could not wait to tell her the ¨tea¨.
P10	I did not have any friends before, i always wondered why?, but now i know that God didn´t want to give m e just anyone because he had my best friend on her way and thank God for her daily.
