desc:	A story of a bird named Mojo

page_text:

P1	Long time ago, Mojo the bird lived in a kingdom called Baro. Tortoise was his friend.

Mojo was a messenger and travelled far to deliver messages.
P2	One day the lion king called for Mojo. 

The king wanted him to deliver an important message to another kingdom. His relative Tiger was the king there.
P3	When Tortoise heard about this he felt jealous.

He advised Mojo, "Do not go. It is a trap. Lion wants to send you as a sacrifice."
P4	Mojo felt scared. The next day, he went to his relative Cock. Mojo told him what Tortoise had said. 

Cock did not trust Tortoise.
P5	"I will make you a delicious meal tonight," offered Tortoise when he met Mojo later. 

Mojo happily went to Tortoise's house for dinner.
P6	As Mojo was relaxing, Tortoise threw a net over him! Then he went out to fetch firewood. 

Mojo could not move. "Help me, help me!" he cried.
P7	Cock was near Tortoise's house. He heard Mojo shouting. He called "Mojo? Mojo?"

"Cock! Come and rescue me! responded Mojo. 

Cock hurried to where Mojo was trapped.
P8	Cock freed Mojo from the net. 

Mojo thanked Cock and they ran away.

Mojo told Lion about this. The king banished Tortoise from the kingdom.
