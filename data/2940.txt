P1	Shaking their heads and trying to brush off the butterflies they said,  "There are no crocodiles here,  we will bring nets and catch the butterflies." And off they went. All the crocodiles got together and said,  "Thank you,  Punch." "Thank you,  butterflies."
P2	The next day Sniffles saw men with nets. He remembered Punch telling him about nets. "Punch,  the nets! Come here quick! The men with the nets have come." All the crocodiles came on the river bank. The butterflies settled on the backs and heads of the crocodiles.
