page_text:

P1	It was a chilly morning. The dew on the grass shined brightly like broken pieces of glass. @@Grade 6 learners of Silala Primary School went on a three-day tour. We were fully prepared for the journey as we waited for the bus to arrived.
P2	That day we were going to visit Tsavo East National Park. The school bus arrived from Ganze and everyone boarded the it. @@I was luck to sit on one of the front seats near the window. Soon, the bus was in motion.
P3	On our way, we saw many beautiful flowers and people walking along the road. When we reached Kilifi town, we bought some samosa. @@A few minutes later, we were on the road and soon, we reached Kaloleni. Our teachers bought cashew nuts for all of us.
P4	At the park, we took photos while we enjoyed playing with some of the monkeys and giraffes. @@We saw elephants, zebras, antelopes and buffalos.
P5	The guide told us that the time was over. Our faces become gloomy when we heard that. @@The teacher then realized that we did not want to leave but we had to so we could arrive home early. We went back to the bus and started our journey back.
P6	We arrived back at school at 7 pm. Our parents and siblings were waiting to escort us home.@@What a wonderful day that was!
