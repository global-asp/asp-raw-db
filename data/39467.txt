page_text:

P1	Juba  was fond of using his catapult or anything he could to stone birds. He dispersed them for pleasure.@@He came back from hunting one hot afternoon. He rushed into his hut and took a raffia mat.
P2	Juba laid the mat under a tree and fell asleep. While he slept, two birds flew to the top of the tree.@@They whispered to each other and sang, "He that stones us, shall pay for it." @@The birds' droppings fell directly on Juba's head as they flew away.
P3	Juba woke up to see his whole face in a mess. He stood up quickly and ran to the river to wash his head.@@As he did so, he was angry with all birds as they flew over his head. "They are mocking me," he thought.
P4	After washing, Juba went back home thinking of how to revenge.@@"The birds that did this to me won't get away with it."
P5	The next day, Juba took his last bowl of maize and sprayed in front of his compound. @@He hid behind his hut with his catapult. He waited for the birds to perch on the maize.
P6	When the birds filled the compound, Juba aimed his catapult to kill them. @@He missed. All the birds flew away to safety.
P7	As he pursued them into the bush, they flew back and ate the maize. @@Before flying away from the compound, they littered it with their droppings.
P8	When Juba returned he was so angry. He took a broom and swept the compound.@@He got angrier after sweeping the birds' droppings but sat down to think. @@He finally understood that trying to revenge against birds was useless. They would always be birds!
P9	Juba made his way to the forest to speak with the birds. He promised that he would not harm them again. @@The birds promised that they would only eat the grains Juba gives them. @@They now made peace.
P10	Juba became a big farmer. He reserved grains for the birds after harvest.@@The birds produced manure for his crops.
