page_text:

P1	There lived a girl called Kalabushe. She talked a lot.
P2	One day, Kalabushe’s aunt fell ill.
P3	That evening, Kalabushe took food to her sick aunt.
P4	Kalabushe met a hyena who had changed into a person.
P5	Kalabushe told him, “I am carrying meat, eggs and milk.”
P6	The hyena licked his lips as he thought about meat.
P7	The hyena ran ahead of Kalabushe to her aunt’s house.
P8	He swallowed Kalabushe’s aunt. He covered himself with her blanket.
P9	Kalabushe arrived and called out, “Aunt, where are you?”
P10	Kalabushe saw someone covered with a big blanket.
P11	Kalabushe asked, “Aunt, why are your ears so big today?”
P12	“Aunt, why are your eyes so big?”
P13	“Aunt, why is your mouth big?” 

The hyena swallowed her!
P14	Kalabushe kept asking questions while inside the hyena’s stomach.
P15	He became tired of Kalabushe’s questions. He spat her out.
P16	Kalabushe and her aunt were rescued by the villagers.
