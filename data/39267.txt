page_text:

P1	She went down the golden savannah plains with her clothes tattered in pieces and her skin dripping with blood where the Roan wolf she had taken in as a pet the other day had fiercely scratched her. She looked weary.
P2	Peekaboo was a gentle and kind soul, she loved flowers,watching the sunset and could talk to animals. @All the damsels and lads in her village thought of her as a queer young lady but Peekaboo didn't care.
P3	On the banks of the river in the savannah plains she had wandered off into, peekaboo noticed a group of animals drinking water. @Among them stood a mysterious Roan Antelope. He was fat as an ealand, but wore a mysterious mask on his face.
P4	Behind the shrubs, peekaboo continued following the Roan Antelope as it gracefully skipped away in the meadow while wagging its tail. @Waterbucks,bushbucks and all the other majestic beasts of the jungle kept following the shy antelope.
P5	When sunset came, the Roan Antelope settled under the african tree of life and finally broke the ice. @"Why are u following me young lady?" Came the majestic creatures voice. @"Curiosity my dear" peakaboo replied.
P6	"Have u come with the hunter, one who feasts on the likes of me and my brothers?" The Antelope asked. @"No, gentle creature i come in peace, the wolf i took turned against me, am here searching for a gentle pet to take home with me"
P7	"Why not wait for the wounds on your skin to heal?" The antelope asked "you are such a sweet and kind soul you deserve the best!" He added. @"Good for me, i think you are the best!" Peekaboo responded and they both smiled. @THE END.
