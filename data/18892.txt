page_text:

P1	My father took me to town in our old blue car. We stopped at a big roundabout to wait for the lights to turn green.
P2	I saw a lady walking on the side of the road. She was wearing a beautiful bright orange dress.
P3	She had a big red belt around her waist.
P4	In her hand,  she carried a shiny little orange handbag.
P5	She wore a pair of shiny orange high-heeled shoes.
P6	She stopped and touched her long hair,  which was held together in the middle with a hairpin.
P7	As she fixed her hairpin,  her handbag fell down. "Ouch," I said feeling bad for her.
P8	The lady bent to pick up her handbag.
P9	I saw long orange earrings as she cleaned the dust off her handbag.
P10	The lights changed green,  and our car drove off,  but I kept looking behind.
P11	"What are you looking at?" my father asked.
P12	"At the lady in orange," I said. I thought of the colour orange all day.
