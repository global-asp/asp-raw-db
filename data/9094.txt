page_text:

P1	Chicken and Millipede were friends. But they were always competing with each other. One day they decided to play football to see who was the best player.
P2	They went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast,  but Millipede was faster. Chicken kicked far,  but Millipede kicked further. Chicken started to feel cross.
P3	They decided to play a penalty shoot-out. First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was the chicken's turn to defend the goal.
P4	Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals!
P5	Chicken was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.
P6	Chicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed the millipede.
P7	As Chicken was walking home,  she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked,  "Have you seen my child?" Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried.
P8	Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. "Help me mom!" cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.
P9	Mother Millipede shouted,  "Use your special power my child!" Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.
P10	Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. The millipede tasted disgusting!
P11	Chicken coughed until she coughed out the millipede in her stomach. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.
P12	From that time,  chickens and millipedes were enemies.
