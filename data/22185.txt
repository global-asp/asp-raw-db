page_text:

P1	Once there was a group of coneys living together.

One of the coneys thought that she was better than the rest of them.
P2	She was bossy and boastful. She was rude to the other coneys

They were often angry about her behaviour.
P3	One day a genet came to this neighbourhood.
P4	The boastful coney said, "Look at that genet. I will wait for him, and strangle him!"
P5	The other coneys tried to convince her that it was not wise to fight with a genet. 

 "You are all cowards," she insulted them.
P6	The genet jumped up and grabbed the boastful coney.

"Help me, help me!" she cried.
P7	Some of the coneys replied, "He will attack us too. We cannot help you."
P8	The terrified coney continued to beg the others for help.
P9	"Where is your is your power now? You said you would strangle the genet. Escape on your own," said the coneys.
P10	The genet ate the coney.

He decided to go back for more.
P11	One coney shouted, "Never be afraid. If we stand together we can beat the genet. We can kill him."
P12	The coneys united and attacked the genet from all directions. 

The genet could not resist them, and he died.
