page_text:

P1	It was Lee the donkey's birthday and he had invited a few friends.@Lam the horse, Ham the chicken, Pal the puppy and Puff the rabbit.
P2	Puff had got all excited and bought Lee a big red baloon.@Puff thought that Ham had brought a baloon too.@They started to argue.
P3	Anyways, Lee had asked his friends to help him decorate the barn yard for the party. @They were in such a rush so they ran around the barn yard even before Lee had brought in the decorations.
P4	They had so much fun decorating the barn yard.@They took sun set colours of paper and swooshed it around.
P5	After the big moment came, everyone had cake and danced around and played around and hung around with Lee.
