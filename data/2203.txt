page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  sly jackal woke up early in the morning. He was very hungry. His tummy gave a big growl. GRRrrrrr! He jumped up and went searching for food.
P2	He wandered around the forest for hours without getting any food. The sun was very hot. Sly jackal could barely see in front of him. All he could think of was his hunger pangs.
P3	"Aaauuuu!" Sly jackal let out a loud scream. He fell into a well right in front of him. He was so hungry that he did not spot it.
P4	"Oh my hat!" he thought. "I have to get out of this well. I will die of hunger."
P5	Sly jackal screamed and shouted: "Help! Anyone help!" Donkey was grazing a few metres away from the well. Donkey heard sly jackal's desperate cry. He came rushing.
P6	"What is the matter?" Donkey was very worried. "The water in this well is cool and sweet. I am bored swimming alone. I need someone to help me swim. Please will you join me?"
P7	"The sun is very hot," said donkey. "I can't swim very well though." "Jump in! I will help you come out of the well," promised the sly jackal.
P8	Donkey jumped into the well. The water was so cool. He was free from the heat. Before he knew it,  the sly jackal had jumped on his back and out of the well. Sly jackal laughed and ran away. Donkey was trapped in the well. He started screaming and shouting: "Help! Anyone help!"
