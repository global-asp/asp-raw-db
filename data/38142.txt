desc:	Professor Mji told the story about Rondavels. How rondavels motivate him to study Mathematics and Science. It was from the love of watching his Grandfather building rondavels and he realised how Mathematics is related to Rondavels.

P1	I never thought as a seven years old boy, you know! I would have decided oh, I will do Math and major in Mathematics! I don't think practically that's what happened, but when I looked back in my life. I know that, there was an influence.
P2	I was a boy aged seven and spend some days sitting under a tree. Thinking about what grandfather was doing.
P3	When I watched my Grandfather building his compound. I wonder oh, my goodness! How do they build these things? You know they build Rondavels, because when we grew up. Most houses were Rondavels.
P4	I would have never understood the difficult Mathematics behind. For example, a circle being an area, the roof, which is a cone shape and some buildings in square shapes.
P5	As I was reaching matric. I would ask myself this question. How would my Grandfather have known about these things? That, this was how to do the circle. At the circular house, and that here is the middle of the house.
P6	All this things have got terms in Mathematics. I know my grandfather was not educated. So, all those things when I look back. I realized they influenced my life. I grew up seeing people applying Mathematics not knowing, what they meant.
P7	I realised when I was at school. Even now at the university that, this is what they were doing. It is now that I understand everything and it make sense.
P8	At the University you must remember the formula and method, in Mathematics. These guys taught them the formula. On how to create cones for the roof? And; how they create the rectangle in the circle, so that they create windows and doors
P9	I did ask one uncle. How does he measure the centre of the circle? He said, "No no my son, you take a rope and put a nail. You put a rope in one point and never removed that point. Then move the nail all around. Do you know what happened?
P10	Uncle did not understand that he was talking about a radius and how equal it is. Because at school we were told; if the lines are drawn from the centre of the circle is a radius.
P11	This was an explanation I got. That, it does not matter where to draw the line. What uncle understood was that, if you don't move one point and you move another point. You are creating a circle and it still stays.
P12	Then you think about it. You go to high school now and you say to the children. What is a radius of this circle? Or what is the area of the circle? It becomes difficult to calculate.
P13	Yet you had uneducated builders. Who would build round houses. Think about it. If it was not a circle, it was going to fall.
P14	It is those things that encourages me to do much more in Science and in teaching and learning of Mathematics.
P15	This is the story of Rondavels and their shapes.
