desc:	Natabo’s favourite pot is broken

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a man and his wife. They had six boys and one girl. The girl's name was Natabo. Both parents loved Natabo more than the boys.
P2	The parents made a small pot as a gift for their daughter. Natabo loved that little pot. She loved to play with it.
P3	One day the boys broke Natabo's pot. It broke into small pieces. The brothers did not know what to do. They threw the pieces into the bush.
P4	Natabo looked for her pot but did not find it. She got very upset,  cried and refused to eat anything. She begged her father,  mother and brothers to look for the pot. They all said that they didn't know where the pot was.
P5	Natabo became even more upset. She ran away from her parents' home and went to the forest. She climbed up the tallest tree.
P6	The parents searched for their daughter. After some time,  they found her up the tallest tree in the forest. They told her to come down,  but she refused. They asked her to come down,  but she still refused.
P7	Natabo's brothers gathered together below the tree. They sang a song to get her to come down. The song went like this: "Our last born. Come down and we can go home. We shall get a new pot."
P8	Natabo made fun of her brothers. She sang the same song,  but imitating the boys. "Ninini-ninio,  ninini-ninio. Ninini-ninio,  ninini-ninio."
P9	Natabo still refused to come down from the tree. So her friend came and tried to get Natabo to climb down. She started singing,  "My friend,  come down and we will go home. We shall get a new pot."
P10	When Natabo heard her friend,  she gradually began to climb down. Her friend continued to sing until Natabo reached the ground.
P11	Natabo and her friend were happy and hugged each other. They walked slowly back to Natabo's home.
P12	When the girls reached home,  Natabo's brothers and parents were joyful. They prepared a party,  and invited many friends and relatives. Everyone enjoyed the party. Especially Natabo with her new pot.
