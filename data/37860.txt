page_text:

P1	Lion Zuki was once the king of jungle. This lion ruled over the years and other animals feared him. Zuki was evil and manipulative. Muthufi was his friend, this elephant was always there for king Zuki even when he knew Zuki was using him.
P2	One day king Zuki threatened to kill everyone who didn't obey his rules. Muthufi knew that Zuki was losing his power but he failed to help him. Zuki was always angry, aggressive and he disrespected his wife. "Oh poor zuki" Luana thought".
P3	Zebras were very scared of Zuki's reaction early on during the gathering. They all decided to leave the kingdom. On their way one of them said.."I knew Zuki was not the rightful heir to the throne, he cannot even rule his pride".
P4	Muthufi was worried but then he also decided to leave his friend for good. He thought that he was doing the right thing but he actually made things worse. After everyone left Zuki was left alone, he died because of hunger and loneliness.
P5	Months after king Zuki's death Luthana declared himself a king. All animals gathered to hear what Luthana had to say. King Luthana came up with better rules that favored everyone in the jungle. He was kind and respectful. He was good.
P6	He told everyone that for him to have a partner to rule the kingdom together, everyone should take part in the GAME OF THRONE that's how Luthana called the game. Animals were excited to play and win fairly now that they were free and happy.
P7	All animals came closer to hear the good news, muthufi was glad to be part of the game because he had never had a chance to play. Muthufi decided to the spear and play first. His confidence came back and Luthana noticed muthufi's new self.
P8	Muthufi took a spear and jumped very high to throw. He didn't really care whether he wins or not. Naomi, Zuki's wife was there also but she did not want to participate because she thought Luthana would remind her of her husband's bad deeds.
P9	Luthana gave everyone a fair chance to play. King Luthana believed that he can change the life of others. He knew that being a king comes with a lot of responsibilities and wisdom. Muthufi became sad all of a sudden, he truly missed Zuki.
P10	During the game, Muthufi's mind was elsewhere. The memories of his old friend came floating like a river. He thought to himself, "I should've stayed and helped him maybe he would be alive by now, oh my dear friend I will never forget you".
P11	King Luthana told everyone to take a moment of silence for king Zuki. After that Luthana paid a good attention at muthufi and he realized that his mood lifted up a bit and he can now smile. Nala was the last player. She was the funny one.
P12	Animals didn't believe Nala was going to win because she was always funny and lazy. Everyone was amazed. Nala was screaming and shouting.."I am the winner". She danced around with her foolish moves and players were given only one chance.
P13	As king Luthana was busy announcing the winner, Nala was already rejoicing and celebrating her luck and her new journey as a ruler. Animals were surprised but Nala did play well and fair. Some animals were willing to be part of ruling team.
P14	Luthana did not agree with what other animals had suggested. Everyone was sad but king Luthana promised to take care of their health and safety. As per agreement of the game Nala and king Luthana officially became ruling partners.
P15	At the end, king Luthana became the king of jungle and he was truthful and trustworthy to all. Luthana knew he's wasn't as powerful as king Zuki was but he was happy to be the ruling king of the new generation @@King Luthana ruled forever.
