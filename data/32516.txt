page_text:

P1	This is Khalai. She is seven years old. Her name means 'the good one.'
P2	Khalai wakes up and talks to the orange tree. "Please orange tree, grow big and give us lots of ripe oranges."
P3	Khalai walks to school. On the way,  she talks to the grass. "Please grass,  grow greener and don't dry up."
P4	Khalai sees flowers. "Please flowers,  keep blooming so I can put you in my hair."
P5	Khalai talks to the tree at her school. "Please tree,  put out big branches so we can read under your shade."
P6	Khalai talks to the hedge round her school. "Please,  grow strong and protect us from bad people."
P7	When Khalai returns home,  she visits the orange tree. "Are your oranges ripe yet?" Khalai asks the tree.
P8	"The oranges are still green," sighs Khalai.  "I will see you tomorrow orange tree," says Khalai. "Perhaps then,  you will have a ripe orange for me!"
