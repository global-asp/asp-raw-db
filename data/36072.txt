desc:	We all know the sound the mosquito makes as it buzzes in the night. Such a tiny insect but such a big pest!

page_text:

P1	Knock! Knock!
P2	"Who is there?" I ask sleepily.
P3	"It is me," a shrill voice says.
P4	"Who is 'me'?" I ask.
P5	"I told you,  it is o-n-l-y m-e," the same voice says.
P6	"I don't know anyone called,  'o-n-l-y m-e'," I reply. I check that my mosquito net is tucked in around my bed.
P7	"Well,  my name is Amos." The voice sounds more shrill than before. It is very close to my ear.
P8	"Amos who?" I ask as I look under the net.
P9	"Amos Quito," the voice finally says. I feel a bite on my ear.
P10	"Ouch!" I jump up and begin to search. "You will pay for this!" I shout.
P11	Angrily,  I get out of bed and switch on the light.
P12	I declare war on the annoying Amos Quito!
