P1	Ɲaliƞo emisi emibbala n'emisi emitono. Emitono jiƞwa hu mibbala jebotonganiamo jityojityo mwiloba omwo. There are big roots and small ones too. The small ones branch off from the big ones. They circle around the tree in the ground.
P2	Emisi jiyeeda hi?
P3	Olwohuba emisi jamaani era jesimiha mwiloba,  jiῃamba era jagumya omusaala mwiloba epunga eya maani ni yiija. They hold the tree firmly in place when a windstorm comes. That is because these roots are strong and are deep in the ground.
P4	Emisi jiyeeda omusaala ohufuna amaaji. Amaaji aga musaala gwenda galimwiloba. Roots are for getting water too, the water a tree needs is in the ground.
P5	Ɲaliƞo obwoya bwemiisi bungi bugaali weene. Buno bunuuna amaaji mwiloba. There are many tiny hairs on the ends of the roots,  these hairs absorbs water from the ground.
P6	Hejaho hu musaala gwosi oguhuli ohupi aƞo, era oƞeege n'ohu himesu hyagwo ehiri mwiloba ohyotali hubonaho. Ehyo hyosi hiri n'omugaso hy'ebyahye ebyoli hubona. Look at any tree around you. And imagine the parts. You cant see, it is as important as the rest.
P7	Singa oheja hu musaala gwosi, obonaho enduli, amasaga, obusaga ko n'amahoose. If you look at any tree, you see a trunk, branches, twigs and leaves.
P8	Aye ehyo si nje hyoƞeene hu musaala.ƞaliƞo bingi bugali weene. Heja ƞaasi w'omusaala. Gujaƞe? Gutiina mwiloba. Eyo ƞaasi eriyo emisi. But that is not all that is on a tree. There is much more. Look at the bottom of the tree trunk,  where does it go, it goes deep down into the ground. Down the tree,  there are roots.
