page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a crocodile living at a river with her young ones.
P2	The crocodile taught her young ones not to trust humans. 

This is because humans have brains.
P3	One day a certain man crossed the river.
P4	The man met the crocodile in the middle of the river and she attacked him.
P5	Just as the crocodile was about to kill him, she remembered her father's words. 

He always told her that people have brains.
P6	The man promised the crocodile that he could bring her human brains. 

So the crocodile released him.
P7	The crocodile and her young ones are still waiting on the riverbank to receive those brains.
P8	Crocodiles are angry to this day because they never received the brains that were promised to them.
