page_text:

P1	Tom and mary lived in a village called malanda together with their parents.Their  home was by the lake-side
P2	one day there was a heavy downpour and the lake overflowed.
P3	More and more animals attacked them as noone came to their aid.All in all they kept on hoping that somebody would hear them out and come to their rescue..
P4	So many animals left the water and attacked their home.They were frightened and decided to call for help.
P5	The water level went up so fast and their house was fully immersed in water..Their screams faded away slowly as they completely got covered by water.That  became their end as they were never seen nor their bodies spotted.
P6	Since that day their fellow villagers migrated to the countryside.
