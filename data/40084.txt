page_text:

P1	Live a good life and heaven will come to you. Be a good girl or boy and finish your joy into heaven. Stairways into heaven. Be kind to your mummy and daddy and don't be rude. Do these things and heaven will come to you. Live a good life.
P2	As said before be nice and kind. Do this and you will be rewarded by walking up the stairs to heaven with God holding your hand congratulating you for making it into heaven. He says you have lived a good life now go to heaven and have fun.
P3	When you die your soul will rise and God will take you to the steps of heaven. Say goodbye to your past life as a better person with a great enjoyment in heaven. Live a great life as a better one approaches
