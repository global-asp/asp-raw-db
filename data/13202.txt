page_text:

P1	Today I am not going to school. It is a holiday!
P2	Today I am not going to watch TV. There is no electricity anyway.
P3	What am I going to do? Today I am going to listen to my body!
P4	First,  I have to be very quiet. So that I can listen to my own body.
P5	Yes,  now I can hear my breath. I breathe in and out,  in and out.
P6	And I can make my breath noisier. Sssssssssssss! And softer. Mmmmmmm.
P7	Now I can hear my heart beating! Doodom, doodoom, dooo dooom.
P8	Can I make my heart go faster or louder? Yes, by jumping up and down twenty times.
P9	Now see, my heart is beating faster.
P10	If I put my fingers on my wrist, then I can feel my pulse!
P11	I can hear myself laughing. Haha, haha, haaah, haaa!
P12	I can hear myself crying. Boohoooo hooo!
P13	I can hear myself clapping. Clap, clap, clap.
P14	I can hear my stomach rumbling! Guddu, guddu, guddu.
P15	My stomach is saying, "Feed me!"
P16	My nose can smell cakes baking in mother's kitchen. And now I want to hear my jaws chewing those cakes!
