page_text:

P1	The journey started at 8: 00 am. On the way to the bats party,  tortoise told the rabbit that once they reach at the party,  he will be called "All of you" and rabbit accepted it.
P2	By 10: 00am they were already at the party,  warmly welcomed by the bats and given seats in one room.
P3	The bats brought tea for them and tortoise asked who should take the tea? The bats replied "it is for all of you."
P4	Tortoise thanked the bats and he started taking the tea alone since he was called all of you at the party.
P5	When Time for lunch came,  food was served. The bats again said,  "This food is for all of you." Immediately Tortoise began eating as the rabbit waited for his food.
P6	Unfortunately the bats did not know that tortoise was called all of you and the Bats found out later that the rabbit did not eat when they came for plates. This shocked the bats because the food was over.
P7	The rabbit then moved out running as tortoise and the bats enjoyed the party.
P8	Ever since then,  tortoise walks slowly because of the food that he ate at the party,  bats swing in the air because they are afraid of rabbit's hunger and rabbit runs so fast because he has to find food to eat somewhere else.
