page_text:

P1	She carried me for nine months.
P2	She made sure that I grew up healthy and strong.
P3	She put me to bed every night.
P4	She made sure that I woke up early every morning.
P5	She took me shopping at the market.
P6	And allowed me to choose my own shoes and clothes.
P7	She counselled me whenever I went wrong.
P8	I will never forget her love in my life.
