P2	Teacher Piti wants to find out how the children coped with lockdown.“I would like to hear about your experiences during lockdown,” he says to the class.Sello begins, “My dad believes everyone should have a set routine.”
P3	“So, he woke us every morning from Monday to Friday, and he would have us do something constructive from 8 am to 2 pm,” says Sello.Munya asks, “What does it mean, ‘something constructive’?”“It is doing something useful and positive,” replies Sello.
P4	“Yes Sello, that’s right,” says Teacher Piti.Sello’s sister Neo adds, “Our dad made sure lockdown was just like school time!”Neo says, “The only thing that I enjoyed about lockdown is that we did lots of activities together as a family.”
P5	Munya says, “I think I used my time quite wisely. I went over my Maths because I want to improve my marks.I watched movies and played outdoor games for entertainment. I also read, to keep myself busy.I did workouts to keep fit.”
P6	Basani says, “With regards to lockdown, I think there were positives and negatives.”“Positive aspects are that I had time to rest, and I spent quality time with my family. I used the time to read books and to revise schoolwork,” she explains.
P7	She continues, “I was worried about whether domestic workers would receive their income.I had anxieties about my family and people continuing to break the law.”Teacher Piti nods. He knows that during the lockdown it was easy to feel uncertain and anxious.
P8	Yash says, “In my family, there are six of us. As much as I love my family, being in their company constantly drove me crazy.To solve this problem, my mom bought the game Monopoly. It was my favourite board game as a kid.”
