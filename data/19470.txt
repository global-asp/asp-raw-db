page_text:

P1	After a long day at the farm,  it was time for all the animals to go to sleep. But that night,  not everyone was willing to listen to the farmer.
P2	"Time for bed Miss Piggy," said the farmer. "In the pen you go."  "Oh no I won't,  I won't go into the pen," said Miss Piggy.
P3	"Trusty Whip,  please whip Miss Piggy into the pen," said the farmer to her trusty whip. "Oh no I won't,  I won't whip Miss Piggy," said Trusty Whip.
P4	"Fiery Fire,  please burn Trusty Whip,  he won't whip Miss Piggy into the pen," said the farmer to the fire. "Oh no,  I won't,  I won't burn Trusty Whip," said Fiery Fire.
P5	"Clear Water,  please put out Fiery Fire,  he won't burn the Trusty Whip,  and Miss Piggy won't go into the pen," said the farmer to the water. "Oh no I won't,  I won't put out the fire," said Clear Water.
P6	Then along came Milky Moo,  the cow. "Milky Moo,  please drink Clear Water,  who won't put out Fiery Fire. Fiery Fire won't burn Trusty Whip,  and Miss Piggy won't go into the pen," said the farmer.
P7	"MOOO!" said thirsty Milky Moo with excitement. "Of course I will drink the water."
P8	"No! No! No! Milky Moo,  please don't drink me," cried Clear Water. "I will put out Fiery Fire."
P9	"Oh no you won't put me out!" shouted Fiery Fire. "I will burn Trusty Whip."
P10	"Please don't burn me Fiery Fire," cried Trusty Whip. "I will whip Miss Piggy into the pen."
P11	Miss Piggy was annoyed. "There will be no need for you to whip me,  Trusty Whip," she said. "I will go into the pen."
P12	In no time at all,  Miss Piggy went into her pen and was ready for bed.
