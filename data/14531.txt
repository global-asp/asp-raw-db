page_text:

P1	Once upon a time all the animals lived together in the bush. The rooster was their chief.
P2	Rooster told the animals that the comb on his head was made of fire. For this reason all the animals feared the rooster.
P3	In those days,  fire was made using a bow drill. One rainy day,  Leopard's bow drill got wet. She could not make a fire to warm her family.
P4	So Leopard sent her cubs to ask Rooster for fire from his comb.
P5	Rooster was in a bad mood. He sent the cubs away without any fire. Leopard was upset when the cubs came back with nothing.
P6	Late that night when Rooster was asleep,  Leopard and cubs went to steal the fire from Rooster's comb. Leopard picked some dry grass outside Rooster's house.
P7	She put the dry grass next to the sleeping Rooster's comb. But the grass did not catch fire. She carefully touched the comb. It was cold!
P8	The cubs also touched the comb. There was no fire! The leopard family all started laughing.
P9	The leopards' laughter woke Rooster and the chickens. Rooster turned his comb towards them,  shouting,  "You should run away. Aren't you afraid?"
P10	Leopard replied,  "We touched your comb and we know about your trick! We'll go back and tell the other animals. They will be angry with you."
P11	The chickens were afraid. They ran away and Rooster ran with them. The chickens left the bush and went to live with people.
P12	Since that time,  chickens have feared leopards and lived with people for protection.
