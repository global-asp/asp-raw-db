page_text:

P1	School was out at Progress Primary and pupils were making their way home after an interesting arts class. Zweli and Thando made beautiful clay pots today.
P2	They went through the woods, jumped the train tracks, and past the camp site that was always dirty. What they didn't know was that danger was on their trail, in a long black coat and blue jeans.
P3	They heard light footsteps on the green grass but before they could turn around, a man grabbed Zweli and yanked him. Thando had such a fright and started to run back the direction they came.
P4	The man dragged Zweli to a mini-bus taxi that was parked in the bushes. There were two other men in the taxi who seemed excited about what was brought before them. Zweli was so afraid and fretting about Thando's whereabouts.
P5	Zweli was placed inside a dark dirty room which had wood nailed on the wall in lieu of a window. He placed his ear against the wood on the wall hoping to hear a voice nearby so he could shout out for help but heard nothing.
P6	After a while, one of the men came in with food on a plate for Zweli to eat. At first Zweli didn't want to eat but hunger was taking it's toll on him and he had to succumb to it.
P7	Zweli started eating the food and the man sat down and lit a cigarette. This made Zweli even more uncomfortable but he was in no position to make demands so he ate his food in silence, while still fretting about his friend.
P8	There was silence in the room and all of sudden "bang", the door opened. It was the other two men carrying Thando. When Zweli saw they also got Thando, he got such a fright that he spilt his food.
P9	Then the men left the two boys in the room and went into theirs, where they were having drinks and smoking. The one with yellow hair said "Just wait 'til we get paid. Those traffickers pay some good money, I tell you"
P10	Meanwhile in the other room, Zweli and Thando had plans of their own. Zweli grabbed some of the pieces of wood on the wall and started pulling as hard as he could. They were as quiet as possible while doing this.
P11	Zweli was able to pull out enough wood from the wall to make a big enough opening. He then helped Thando through the opening and got himself out as well. They then ran home as fast as they could and told the police about the three men.
