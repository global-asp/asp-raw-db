page_text:

P1	Long ago, there was a famine in the land of Fommbina. People were forced to dig in ant hills to find grains.
P2	There was a man who couldn't provide food for his family. One day, he said to his wife, "Let me go and look for food." He left.
P3	While he was away, the wife couldn't wait for his return. So she cooked some pumpkin that she got from her mother for the children.
P4	The husband come back late, with nothing for the family. The wife welcomed him and asked, "Anything for the children to eat?" He replied, "No." 

She gave him some pumpkin, but it didn't satisfy him.
P5	He asked, "Where did you get the pumpkin?" 

The wife replied, "My mother keeps pumpkins on the roof of her room."
P6	At midnight, the husband woke up. 

He decided to go to his mother-in-law to steal the remaining pumpkins. 

He went to get a ladder.
P7	He put up the ladder and climbed to the old woman's roof.
P8	The man began to walk across the roof towards the pumpkins. 

Suddenly he fell through the roof, making a big noise! Pararam!
P9	He stood up quickly. 

"Salaamu alaykum, old woman, we are people from the sky! I am one of the three coming after you. I am the first, others are coming," said the man.
P10	The old woman got a huge fright. She was terrified.
P11	She rushed to the door to escape. But the man suddenly ran out before her.
P12	Both crying for help, the man ran eastward and the old woman ran westward.
