page_text:

P1	It was a hot summer afternoon and a very thirsty crow.   was flying above the ground
P2	Looking for some water to quench his thirst.
P3	All his search went in vain.
P4	The sun' s heat had dried up all the water and there was not a drop of water.to be found anywhere.
P5	after a long search.The crow finally spotted an  abandoned  pitcher under a tree.
P6	He flew down to it.
P7	and was delighted to see some water.still left in the pitcher.
P8	But the crow could not reach it's beak to the water all the way down to the bottom of the pitcher.
P9	He was sad because he had flown very far to finally find some water.but could not reach the water  lying at the bottom of the pitcher.
P10	However , he did not give up his hopes of getting the water. He looked around. to see if it could solve this problem somehow.
P11	Just then he  spotted many pebbles.lying nearby the pitcher. He thought for a while.
P12	and a  brilliant idea struck his mind.
P13	He hurriedly started picking up the pebbles and the dropped them into the pitcher one by one. very soon , the pebbles dicplaced the water at the bottom of the pitcher .
P14	and the water slowly sterted raising up the pitcher. So the crow continued dropping the pebbles. and soon the water rose .
P15	to the mouth of the pitcher.The crow gulped the water to his content and quenched his thirst.The smart crow was all refreshed and happy.
P16	He flew back to the sky. leaving behind a lesson that. " Where there is a will , there is a way ".
P17	if you have a positive attitude and if you think through with an open mind you can resolve most of the problems that come in your way.
