P1	Once a day the big blue bus stops in Bubu's village to pick up people to go to town. Bubu has never seen such a big bus. He counts 9 passenger windows and a window for the driver. "There must be 9 rows of passenger seats with at least 8 seats in a row," Bubu thinks.

If Bubu is right, how many passengers can the big blue bus carry?
P2	Tomorrow, Bubu's mother will take him to town to buy a new school uniform. She sells eggs for R15 a dozen. Most weeks she makes R450. How many dozen eggs does she need to sell to make R450? For the last 4 weeks, she has been able to save half her money to pay for Bubu's new uniform.

Can you work out how much money she saved in 4 weeks?
P3	It's almost three months since Bubu's last bus trip. He cannot wait!

Tomorrow is the big day. By seven o'clock, he is in bed, but he can't fall asleep. His mind is racing. He can't stop thinking about the trip to town. It's already half past nine, but Bubu is still wide awake.
P4	Every morning, Bubu's mother wakes him at seven o'clock. But today he is already wide awake by six o'clock, even though he only went to sleep at eleven o'clock last night.

By seven o'clock he is washed and dressed and ready to go. How long did Bubu sleep last night?
P5	At quarter to eight Bubu and his mother get to the bus stop. The big blue bus is supposed to arrive by eight o'clock.

Bubu's mother checks her watch. The big blue bus is already fifteen minutes late."But the bus is always on time. I wonder what the problem is?" she says.
P6	Soon more people join them at the bus stop. They also look at their watches and ask why the bus is late. "It is already nine o'clock. I am going to be late for work!" says the bald man in the blue suit.

Bubu and his mother have been waiting the longest. To Bubu, it feels like hours and hours. But it isn't really. How long have they been waiting?
P7	Bubu is worried. "Will I ever get my uniform?" he asks his mother.

Bubu works out that the trip to town and back will take about 4 hours. An hour to get there, 2 hours to shop and 1 hour to get back. "I have a soccer game with my friends at two o'clock. I hope the bus comes soon or we won't make it home in time."
P8	Still they wait. By now Bubu is crying. Two of the people in the queue leave to go home. Others keep checking the time on their watches.

"Let's be patient. I am sure the bus is coming soon," Bubu's mother tells them. "I want to go home!" wails Bubu. "Just another ten minutes," she tells him. "If the bus is not here by half past nine we can go home."
P9	Just then they hear the bus roaring up the road. "You see I told you," Bubu's mother says. "It's half past nine on the dot. We will do our shopping quickly. If the bus leaves town on time, we will be home before your soccer game."

Bubu wipes away his tears. His feet are sore. He feels tired. He can't wait to get on the bus.
P10	To everyone's surprise, it isn't the big blue bus. It is a little red bus. Bubu counts only 4 passenger windows on the side of the bus. "Mama," says Bubu, "this is so much smaller than the blue bus. There will never be enough room for all the people going to town."

Do you agree with Bubu? Can you guess how many passengers the little red bus can carry?
P11	"You worry too much Bubu," his mother teases him. "At least all of us waiting at this stop will get a seat."

"Quick, let's hop on and get the best seats. We've been waiting the longest!"
P12	Bubu and his mother get on the bus. Behind them are 9 more people in the queue."Will there be enough seats for all of us?" Bubu asks.

He can see there are 4 rows of seats on the bus, with 2 seats on one side and 2 seats on the other. How many seats are there altogether? Will all the people in the queue be able to sit?
P13	Bubu and his mother take the 2 front seats next to the door. They have lots of space in front of them and a good view outside.

Bubu counts 6 new people that have joined the queue."That makes 17 passengers altogether," he thinks. "Mama, there's space for almost everyone," he tells his mother. "Only one person will have to stand."

Did Bubu count correctly?
P14	Now the bus is full. The driver closes the doors and pulls off. There is a noise outside. Bubu and the other passengers look out the window.

More people are running to catch the bus. They shout, "Stop! Stop! We also need a ride." But it is too late. Bubu and his mother feel sorry for the people left behind.
P15	Bubu's mother asks the driver, "Why didn't you come in the big blue bus?" "It broke down yesterday," he said. "This small red bus was the only one there was."

"But what about all the people we left behind?" Bubu's mother asks him. "Don't worry," says the driver, "I plan to make at least another two trips today."

Bubu listens as they speak. Numbers are going through his head.
P16	Bubu counts the seats again. "This bus carries 20 people, 16 sitting and 4 standing." 

"I wonder how many trips the bus will have to make to carry 100 passengers to town? What about 200 or 150 passengers?" he asks himself. Can you work out the answer?

Bubu is happy. Soon he'll have his new uniform. Then the bus will take them back home, in time for soccer.
