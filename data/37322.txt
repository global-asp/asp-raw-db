page_text:

P1	If I ran the world, many things I would change.
P2	First, I would make it a law, that  you would have to spare, three hours a day in planting trees. So there!
P3	If people would hide in their office all day, ia would say, "Come out it's time to play!"
P4	If I ran the world: All creatures would be treated the same, no matter what they looked like, did, or gained.
P5	Creatures big, and creatures small; from elephants, to ants, to geese, all would learn to live in peace.
P6	And if your heart, got all jumbled up; all your family and freids would build it back up.
P7	If I ran the world, all things would get care. The stars and the trees;  the sun and the sky; the grass and the leaves; and the mountains so high!
P8	So you see; if I ran the world, things would be a lot better off. So There!
