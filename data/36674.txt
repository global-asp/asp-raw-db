page_text:

P1	My name is Kristina and I am fifteen years old. I live with my mother, my younger sister and brother.@@My mother started drinking heavily five years ago soon after father died.
P2	Life became very difficult for us since father died. It got worse during Covid-19.@@I had to borrow food from neighbours who could spare a little to share.
P3	One day, I thought, "I will talk with mother. We can't live like this forever."@@But mother didn't want to listen to me and she didn't explain anything.
P4	She was about to beat me up but neighbours came quickly and rescued me.@@The next morning, I took my little sister and brother to one of our neighbours. Then I went to look for work.
P5	I met up with my friend Maria at the Kona Kiosk, as we had agreed. I returned home with some money and food, but very tired.@@Mother asked, "Where did you get the money? Are you working?"@@"I will tell you tomorrow, mother."
P6	The next day, a man picked me up from the Kona Kiosk in a big car.@@I ironed so many clothes, cleaned his big house and washed the young children.@@He dropped me back at the Kona Kiosk in the evening.
P7	I did this for four weeks until I began feeling sick.@@Mother was so drunk that she didn't know what was going on.@@When neighbours took me to hospital, I tested positive for Covid -19.
P8	Luckily, no one else who had been in contact with me had contracted the virus.@@I was taken to a quarantine centre ran by our church.@@My mother realised that she needed to take care of us. It was as if she woke up from sleep!
