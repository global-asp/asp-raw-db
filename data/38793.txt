P1	It was a bright and sunny morning when Lilly mom went to wake her up. "Lilly hunny you are late" she said. Today Lilly had to present infront of her class. And the recording will be posted to the school blog.
P2	As Lilly entered the classroom, she could hear her teacher congratulating Alicia on her story. This gesture made Lilly held her head high as she went to share her story with the entire class.
P3	In the middle of her story, Lilly mispronounced a word and that's where the snicker began. The loud snickering of Sam and John ruined Lilly's story, but she managed to finish and the kind words from her teacher made it a lot better.
P4	better. Soon came the next day after the recording was posted to the school blog, Sam and John made mean comments about Lilly presentation.
P5	Lilly dashed out of the classroom whilst crying, her teacher decided that it is better if she goes home.
P6	On the drive home Lilly mother was already aware of what had happened, so she along with the other parents came up with a brilliant idea to teach the students about cyber bullying.
P7	The parents shared that these mean acts can make Lilly a very angry girl. Grrrrhhhh went Lilly.
P8	"Lilly was humiliated" said another.
P9	Lilly even felt vulnerable and insecure about ever reading in class again. Which took a toll on her self-esteem.
P10	Another parent shared that, cyberbullying may also cause Lilly to lose interest in her school work.
P11	"Did you know that being cyberbullied, made Lilly lose interest in coming to school today" siad another parent.
P12	Lilly mom even shared with the class that Lilly refused to eat anything she had prepared, because of what Sam and John had to share.
P13	It was so clear that Lilly didn't get any sleep. She stayed up all night wondering what the next school day may bring. At the end of the presentation they shared that bullying isn't nice and that they should all be kind to one another.
