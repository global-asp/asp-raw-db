desc:	There was a boy called Tom whose parents told him not to go near an abandoned house. Tom did not listen

page_text:

P1	Tom was a very inquisitive young fellow who loved exploring.
P2	His parents knew this so they warned him about visiting a certain house.
P3	One day Tom was riding his bicycle near the abandoned house his parents had warned him about. He decided to go closer and look, but not go in.
P4	But his curiosity overcame him! He decided just to open the door and peep inside.
P5	But he got even more curious. He wanted to step inside and get a better view. When he did, the house was dark and empty.
P6	Tom wondered if the whole house was the same way, so he slowly crept around the house. Suddenly he heard the front door shut and footsteps heading his way.
P7	Tom  panicked. He looked frantically for a way out. Finally he found a window, climbed out and ran home.
P8	What do you think his parents said when he got home?
