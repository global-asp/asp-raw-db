P1	Have you ever been you Loch Ness. You havent! Well leganged has it there is a monster. It has a long body and a beady eyes.
P2	But some look more believable than others. People have been trying to prove their sightings for years. Although some just cant fall people. Maybe it is just an evolved sea snake/slug and it does not have as long body as expected.
P3	Considering scientists have not been able to find it. Some people make a living out of it by doing boat trips and selling even making tv shows.
