desc:	Is Ajao the bat a bird or a rat?

page_text:

P1	Ajao,  a bat,  lay in his house very ill. There was no one to attend to him.
P2	Then,  Ajao died.
P3	The neighbours said,  "Ajao is dead. We must call his relations to come and bury him."
P4	The neighbours went and called the birds saying,  "A relative of yours is dead."
P5	The birds came and saw that it was Ajao. They said,  "This animal is not part of our family."
P6	"All our family have feathers but Ajao has none. So,  he is not one of us." The birds went away.
P7	The neighbours reasoned together. They agreed,  "The birds are right. Ajao has no feathers. So,  he is not their relative."
P8	One of them said,  "He must be part of the family of rats. He looks like them."
P9	The neighbours went and called the rats saying,  "One of your family is dead."
P10	The rats came and saw that it was Ajao. They said,  "This animal is not part of our family."
P11	"Everyone in our family has a tail. Ajao has no tail." The rats went away.
P12	No relations were found for Ajao and he remained unburied.
