page_text:

P1	I am Helen Abraraw. I was born of my mother Asnaku Yilma and my father Abraraw Worku on Monday, December 16, 1999 Ethiopian Calendar. I was separated from my father a few years after my birth.
P2	I started living in Adwa town, Tigray, Ethiopia with my family within the 20th regiment. My mother worked there for the Ethiopian army.
P3	At 2:00 AM of November 4, 2020 I heard shooting from Adigrat city while I was asleep. In the morning I went outside to see the Ethiopian soldiers fight among themselves. I was shocked to see the Tigray soldiers imprison the non-Tigray ones.
P4	The soldiers forced my mother to cook food for a long time. Then, when the Ethiopian army controlled Tigray region, the Tigray militia at Adigrat went into hiding.
P5	Afterwards, the 33rd regiment entered Adigrat. As a result, I and my family felt very happy.
P6	I was accepted by Mesfin, a soldier, as a daughter. As a child, I was separated from my biological father. My new father's coming made me happy.
P7	Six months after the war started, we left Tigray and peacefully entered Gondar town. After a week I entered Debre Birhan town where my grandmother and extended family live. I was introduced with them for the first time.
P8	I am living and learning in Debre Birhan. I get surprised when I remember what happened during the war. Here I got love, patience, unity and care with God's will.
