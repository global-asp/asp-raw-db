P1	Tick-tock,  tick-tock. It's the sound of my father's sewing machine. Even with the tick-tock,  tick-tock,  my father hears us when we arrive from school. "David,  John,  come here!" he calls.
P2	"John,  sit down beside me," says father. "My son,  come and learn to be a tailor." John sits beside his father and learns. But my brother is sad. In the evening,   John says,  "I do not want to be tailor. I want to be a teacher. I like to teach."
P3	Father replies that our grandfather and great-grandfather were tailors. Now he is a tailor.  "Then it will be the turn of John. It's our family that makes clothes for the villagers, " says father.  John already knows how to take measurements,  cut cloth and sew. But he wants to be a teacher.
P4	During the weekend,  John helps boys and girls who have difficulties at school. John's classroom is under a large cashew tree. The boys and girls agree that John can explain very well.
P5	When my teacher tells us about the professions,  she says,  "All professions are important. The farmers,  artists,  nurses,  truckers,  police officers,  carpenters,  pastors,  tailors and teachers are all important!"
P6	I draw a tailor and a teacher. I show it to my friends,  and tell them,  "I will give this picture to my brother!" I take home the drawing. My brother John is very fond of my drawing.  He hangs the drawing on the wall. As we return from school,  the sewing machine of our father makes the sound,  "Tick-tock,  tick-tock."
P7	My father has a big bandage on his finger. He is upset. "I broke my finger and it hurts so much that I cannot work! I have school uniforms to make," says father. "We will help you!" says John. I cannot sew,  but John says to me,  "I'll teach you,  David!" Father looks at us and manages to smile.
P8	I am pleased,  "We completed the first uniform!" Father thinks John is a good tailor and a good teacher. "One day you'll have a classroom and many students!" says father.  "Dad,  John already has a classroom. It's under the cashew tree! He teaches during the weekend," I tell father.
P9	Our father went to the hospital. His finger is still not good.  When I introduce my brother to my friends,  I say,  "This is my brother! He's a good tailor. He helps our father after school. He will be the best teacher in Mozambique!"
