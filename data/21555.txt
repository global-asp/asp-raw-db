P1	There once lived a king and his beautiful daughter. Men asked for her hand in marriage but the king refused. The King said that his daughter would only be married to a very wealthy man.
P2	One day a man walked into the kings palace to asked the king if he could let him marry the beautiful girl. The king asked him what he would give in return and the man said that he had gold and many cows to give as bride price.
P3	The King was very happy and called his daughter. When the daughter came the girl liked the rich man and the king decided to marry her off.
P4	The girl cooked and the king went to call his relatives to come and meet his bride. The relatives came for dinner. As the man walked in the house he realized that his wife was not very happy. "What is the matter my wife?" asked the man. "I have never cooked in my life" replied his wife.
P5	The man was very disappointed. He told his wife that they would eat whatever it is that she will cook. The girl went to the kitchen and cooked very bad food. When the food was brought to the table, the visitors tasted and said it was awful. The rich man took the girl back to the king and the king gave him back his gold and his cows. 
The disappointed took back his daughter
