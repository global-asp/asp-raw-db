P1	"Your cooking is terrible," said Mama to Edna.
P2	"Nothing I cook is good enough for Mama," wailed Edna to her husband.
P3	"Oh my, don't cry," comforted Eric. 

"We will find a solution," he said to Edna.
P4	Eric thought all day, until finally he knew what to say.
P5	"Elephant stew?!" cried Edna. "I've never cooked an elephant before.".
P6	"Oh go on, give it a try, my love," persuaded Eric.


Finally Edna agreed, "I'll cook an elephant, I will!".
P7	Eric bought a small elephant at the market.
P8	Edna boiled the elephant in a pot.

Poor elephant!.
