page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there lived a farmer in a small village. His name was  Baba Tinga.
P2	Baba Tinga was a poor man. He did not have a wife or children who would take care of him, cook, or even wash his clothes.
P3	One morning, Baba Tinga was out farming. He found an egg under a mango tree.
P4	“I will keep this egg until I am very hungry”, he said to himself. He went and put the egg in the corner of his room.
P5	The next morning, Baba Tinga went to the farm. When he came back to the house, he found that food was served on the table for him.
P6	He was surprised and he wondered who had been so kind to him. This continued for several  days.
P7	One day, he came back early from his farm and found a very beautiful woman cooking in his kitchen. With a surprised look, Baba Tinga asked the woman “Who are you? and where do you come from?”
P8	She replied, “I am the daughter of an egg. If you want me to stay here and be your wife, I will do so; but you must obey my orders and never call me the daughter of an egg”, said the woman.
P9	Baba Tinga was very pleased with his new wife. He later had many children with her.
P10	He became a very happy and rich man. His wife was happy too.
P11	One day, Baba Tinga’s wife asked him, “Would you want to become the chief of this village?”.  “Yes, I would!” Baba Tinga replied.
P12	A very big crowd had gathered around Baba Tinga. They made him the chief of the village. They gave him the chief’s name, Naba Tinga.
P13	After some time, Naba Tinga became proud, forgetting that he had once been a poor man.
P14	Naba Tinga did not respect anyone in the village, even his elders. Also, he did not listen to those who went to ask him for help.
P15	One day, Naba Tinga got so drunk that he could not walk. “Come here!” he shouted at his wife, “Come and help me!”
P16	His wife ignored him. He became mad and shouted, “Come here you daughter of an egg! Can you not hear? I called you daughter of an egg, and so you are.”
P17	After some time, Naba Tinga fell asleep and slept until midnight. When he began to feel cold, he put out his hand for his blanket. He touched only the floor of his room and did not find anything.
P18	Naba Tinga sat up and looked around him. To his amazement, he saw that all of his riches were gone; his wife and children were also gone. The only thing left for him was an old cloth.
P19	Naba Tings became a poor man again.
