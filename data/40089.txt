P1	I was getting ready to go to school so I put on my Clothes
P2	I put my stuff in my backpack I was thinking about the food Daddy was making
P3	Today we were going to the zoo to learn about animals so that’s why I got up early because I don’t want the bus to leave me
P4	I went inside the kitchen to see what’s for Home lunch because I have to have a full stomach before I go to school
P5	I said what’s that dad? I was curious
P6	Dad said it was porridge he add some sugar but I didn’t want it
P7	Try it try it you might like it you don’t know what is going to happen
P8	So I decided to try it and then…
P9	I loved it guys always try food to see if you like it or not because you won’t know any food if you don’t try them
