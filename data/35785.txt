page_text:

P1	Once upon a time. There was a zara. Who always took Rishtah photos, because all she wanted was to do was "Shadi" ..
P2	And one day she found her sapno ka raaja.. because she was THAT cheesy. But zara.. being zara did not care for the raja she wanted the cake...
P3	just like her sneaky aunty.. who was waitimg for the cake. She gave everyone thin slices and had the biggest one all to herself.
P4	This all happened when the judge finally said ...
P5	It was a happy happy day all the kids danced in joy.. The adults laughed and had great food. The groom had just realized what he had gotten into but ... Too late ma maaaayn..
P6	The crowd was cheering for the bride .. and prayed silently for the groom (RIP)..
P7	Finally the wait for was over. They saw the bride drooling over the cake so they had to cut it ... so people could take sober pictures without any saliva..
P8	The bride ate as if it was the last cake ever to be served.. the groom almost lost his four fingers.. She ignored the little girl asking for some cake and went with the bite... zara the cakezilla..
P9	Finally they took some pretty pictures where the bride made all sort of faces..
P10	Then they took a family photo, but it was almost impossible to breathe, There is always that one cousin who just has to eat more that he is suppose to.. and bombs the innocent lives around..
P11	The end.
