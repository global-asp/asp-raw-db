P1	Bean and Burning Coal were friends. They liked to do things together.
P2	One day they went out for a walk. They came to a river. "Who is going to cross the river first?" they asked each other.
P3	He started walking across a thin branch over the river. The wind blew. Burning Wood glowed and burst into flame.
P4	The branch broke,  and Burning Coal fell into the river. There was a loud noise 'Ssssss ' Smoke came from Burning Coal.
P5	Bean laughed so much that he broke into two pieces.
P6	From that day on,  burning coal becomes black when it gets wet. From that day on,  a bean is divided into two parts.
