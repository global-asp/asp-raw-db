P1	Long ago, in a remote village called Atembi, there lived Mboki and Temi. The two were known all over the village as the brave siblings and they were accorded a lot of respect by the villagers.
P2	Mboki and Temi were born into a humble nomadic family. Most of their lives, they lived as nomads, moving from one place to another in search of better pasture for their animals. They received most of their education through apprenticeship.
P3	Living a nomadic life came with it's challenges as they would not be able to settle in one place for a long time as the pasture and water bodies became dry after sometime. Because of this, they were not able to attend a normal school.
P4	However, they developed skills as they learned through apprenticeship. They learned how make weapons and crafts to protect them from wild animals that would occasionally attack them during their grazing periods.
