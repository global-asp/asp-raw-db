desc:	About a boy who doesnt use his ears to hear. Who thinks he is cleverer than all the guardians. Mangoes are good fruits and we should wait patiently for them to ripe. Patience is the key.

page_text:

P1	Once upon time there were children who had no manners at all. They didn't have patience either. They did what they wanted as long as it pleases them.  But the earth was watching all this and was just about to do something  as it saw...
P2	Amo lives with his gogo in Soshanguve. Gogo planted a mango tree four years back and this year would be the first time the mango tree bared its fruits. Gogo was very happy and patiently waiting for them to be ripe and harvest them.
P3	Everyday after Amo had porridge as a breakfast, before he could go to school, he went to the tree and steal at least 2 mangoes for him and his friends.At school during break time they would enjoy eating stolen mangoes with spices or salt.
P4	Amo and his friends plans who will come with chicken spice or Raja the next day at school, but he always picks to come with Gogo's mangoes. Gogo was not aware at of Amo's behaviour. She would water the plants with love and patiently waiting
P5	Amo's behaviour gotten worse after a week as he no longer share his stolen mangoes with his friends at school but would wait for after school to eat the mangoes with some barbecue spice alone on the road. This made him to be friendless.
P6	After 3 weeks as Gogo was walking in her garden she sow that the Mangos were way less than they were last 2 week ago. She wondered alone what could have happened.  Was it the birds? Was there a wind? Maybe the warms ? She had no idea...
P7	Amo would now steal from his neighbours too. The neighbour tried to reprimand him but he wouldn't listen but would run home and wait for another chance where there is nobody watching him. But the earth was about to do something...
P8	The same day he was caught right handed but he had no remorse, he picked the Mango as first as he could. He was so careful that he didn't slip or slide off the tree. He quickly ran home eating the Mango and was not ashamed of his behaviour.
P9	The neighbour's heart broke, Gogo's heart broke at the deeds of a young boy called Amo. Everyone tried to talk to him but he would not change.  First his teacher who caught them, then his friends at school, then the neighbours.
P10	The neighbour and Gogo tried so hard to talk to him, but Amo chose not to listen to all those people thinking he is super clever, but the earth was about to do something with this young man who lacks manners.
P11	The following day Amo went on his normalised bad habits and picked the not ripped mango. Right away he immediately ate it with chicken spice and salt. But the earth was doing count down as he felt something moving in his mouth.
P12	What was it?  Was it a ripped Mango now having hairs? Did he eat a Mango leaf? Was it a worm? What was it? He could swallow the last bite of the Mango, he then spit it and check what was it. But the earth was about to do something
P13	As he checks out the Mango he sow something like a worm. He couldn't believe it. Same moment there was a loud ting noise in his ears. His stomach was crumbling and he had stomach aches and headaches. The earth sorted him out.
P14	He rushed home, on the way his friends come to help him and carried him home. He had a bad stomach aches and was in serious pains.  The friends and Gogo went to nearby clinic to ask for medication. But there was nothing much to give..
P15	He suffered from stomach aches afterward and that was his last time stealing unripe fruits. Gogo kept on preparing him a porridge because she loved him. Amo learned his lesson. Ripped Mango are healthy than unripe mangoes.  So have Patience
