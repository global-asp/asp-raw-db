page_text:

P1	When we work hard, it makes us appreciate what we have so much more.
P2	It's a time for learning from our elders.friends and family. They give us knowledge and wisdom , to guide us down the right path in life.
P3	Our elders work and struggle so that we can have a better life than they have had to endure.We must soak up all the wisdom and knowledge they consistently preach to us.
P4	They suffer through so much , it's only right that we take the load off someone's back when we see they need a hand. Trust me , there is a lot of Love in Labor. Especially  knowing you worked hard to provide for your family .
P5	Work hard, Be Kind To Everyone , and Love your Family   .Always remember Love comes out of Labor!
