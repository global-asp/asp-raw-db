page_text:

P1	One day, Chameleon challenged Rabbit to a race to see who was faster.
P2	Rabbit accepted, saying, "You are so slow! You start with one foot, then stop and start with the other. I'm going to leave you far behind. You'll never catch me!"
P3	So, they invited all the animals to come and watch.
P4	Chameleon and Rabbit lined up and waited for the signal.
P5	When the race began, Chameleon jumped onto Rabbit's tail.
P6	The animals laughed and laughed.@@Rabbit did not realise that Chameleon was on his tail.
P7	Hearing the noise, Rabbit skidded to a stop. @@Chameleon jumped off, and said, "Hey! Watch where you're going! It's about time you got here."
P8	Rabbit was amazed. He started running again, not knowing that Chameleon had once again jumped onto his tail.
P9	As they approached the finish, the animals clapped their hands, laughing at the sight of Chameleon still on Rabbit's tail.@@Rabbit heard the noise and thought that Chameleon had arrived.
P10	When they arrived at the finish line, Chameleon jumped off and said, "Don't step on me! I got here first!"
P11	Rabbit stormed off in a temper. Chameleon stayed to receive the prize, and Rabbit lost.
