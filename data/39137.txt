page_text:

P1	One day, one very nice and classic sunny South African day. Now we meet boy, boy is the main character. He is a young 13 year old male, with rather short hair and 5’0ft tall. He likes sports, gaming and animals.
P2	He has a fear of dogs (Cynophobia) which he thinks he has overcome but he hasn’t. On one beautiful Sunday he received an invite from his friend to celebrate his birthday at his house. It’s a sleepover party and he’s excited but there’s a
P3	twist, his friend has dogs and 1 wouldn’t be a problem but he doesn’t have 1 not 2 but 4. It’s now Monday and he’s very excited but he keeps nagging his friend on whether his dogs are friendly. The boy remembers that all his close friends
P4	will be at the party with him so he gets more comfortable.
P5	The boy kept doing so until Thursday. His heart beats with worry and excitement as it is the day before he has to confront his biggest fear: cynophobia.
P6	It’s his average orientation week for him and it’s pretty easy. For maths however it was different as it was quite boring with a new maths teacher.
P7	English was quite disappointing for him but still ok, he really enjoyed natural science and all the other lessons.
P8	His grandmother picks him up at the end of the school day (14:40) He’s at home watching videos on how to conquer your fears as well as Caesar Milan videos thinking that they would help, spoiler alert, they didn’t.
P9	He’s at home and he’s doing some homework, as his parents call him down for food he eats and enjoys the food and the talk with his family, he goes upstairs and watches YouTube with the thought of tomorrow you’ll have to confront your fear.
P10	It’s 6:40 and the boy is preparing for school and his heart is beating tremendously but he remembers that he should be fine for the day until the friend's mother finishes work before we leave.  So he realises he should focus on what is
P11	infront of not what's about to be in front of him. He heads on to school without worry, and like he planned he just relaxed. At break the played football and chilled for the most part. He went through all the lessons and enjoyed most mostly
P12	because it was orientation week so it was very easy and was mostly introductions.
P13	It’s towards the end of the day now, and the boy and his friends head down to the car with their bags and belongings. They are sitting by the car relaxing and talking to each other.  One of the friends makes a suggestion to go play football
P14	by the fields, having nothing to do they “why not.” So they start heading down to play, they end up having lots of fun until the birthday boy's brother comes and fate strikes. He realises that whether he likes it or not he has to leave the
P15	Field. They head up to the car, his heart starts to beat harder and harder and his heart continues to race. They reach the car and he sees his friend's mother by the car waiting for us as we load our bags in the car and get in.
P16	Once we were all at the car headed off, we were vibing in the car listening to music and conversing with each other. This was very fun but it all got very tense (for me of course) as the music stopped and the car slowed down halfway down
P17	the street and I knew that we had arrived. The gate opened and it felt like slow motion as we turned into the overcover for the car. One opened the car door, my friends stepped out and so did the birthday boy.
P18	Got out and I shouted his name in fear as the dogs barked. He stopped and looked at me in confusion and asked what’s wrong and he realised that I wasn’t comfortable.  I said “Please close the door!.
P19	and he did so, I sat there in the car with his mother in tears not wanting and even refusing to get out of that car. I was there for a minute or so and his mother suggested that we leave the car and ignore the dogs, so with no other real
P20	option I did because I know for a fact I wasn’t staying in the car for any longer. So I got out of the car very reluctantly and started walking slowly toward the front door.  And I am greeted by quite a big and scary looking dog by the door
P21	and in the moment I was so shocked by the calmness of the dogs. I was expecting the dogs to bark and jump but they didn't. I was still quite scared of the dogs.
P22	The birthday boy told us that he had put the biggest one in the bathroom so I was a bit calmer but suddenly I saw this dog and let me tell I got so scared because of the massive size of this dog. So not surprisingly my heart started to beat
P23	very fast again as the dog approached me to greet me, I just stood there trying to ignore it. So now I was rather calm and I saw the rest of the guys playing pool. So I decided to go play with them and I like pool so I decided to join and I
P24	had fun. I tried to ignore the dogs and in about 10 minutes I was perfectly ok. After another 5 minutes I was already petting the dogs and even the one I was originally scared of.
P25	We had just come back from school after being cut off from our play. So my friends said “Gents let's go play some football” we were bored so we said “Why not”. We played for a bit and it was very hilarious.
P26	One of my friends stepped in dog poop, The ball got kicked onto the street twice and most importantly I had fun. @@I think if you have cynophobia or a phobia of heights or even any fear. My idea and suggestion is for you to jump into it.
P27	Trust me I thought that it was dumb for me to get out of the car but I did and I don’t regret it for 1 second.
P28	Swahili/kiswahili
P29	Mvulana na mbwa 4@ Siku moja, siku moja nzuri sana na ya kawaida ya jua ya Afrika Kusini.  Sasa tunakutana mvulana, mvulana ndiye mhusika mkuu.  Ni kijana wa kiume mwenye umri wa miaka 13, mwenye nywele fupi na urefu wa futi 5Ɔ.
P30	Anapenda michezo, michezo ya kubahatisha na wanyama.  Ana hofu ya mbwa (Cynophobia) ambayo anadhani ameishinda lakini hajaishinda.  Jumapili moja nzuri alipokea mwaliko kutoka kwa rafiki yake kusherehekea siku yake ya kuzaliwa nyumbani.
P31	kwake.  Ni tafrija ya kulala na amesisimka lakini kuna twist, rafiki yake ana mbwa na 1 isingekuwa shida lakini hana 1 sio 2 lakini 4. Sasa ni jumatatu anafuraha sana lakini anaendelea kumzonga rafiki yake.
P32	kama mbwa wake ni wa kirafiki.  Mvulana huyo anakumbuka kwamba marafiki zake wote wa karibu watakuwa kwenye karamu pamoja naye ili apate starehe zaidi.
P33	Mvulana aliendelea kufanya hivyo hadi Alhamisi.  Moyo wake unadunda kwa wasiwasi na msisimko kwani ni siku moja kabla ya yeye kukabiliana na hofu yake kuu: cynophobia.  Ni wiki yake ya mwelekeo wa wastani kwake na ni rahisi sana.
P34	Kwa hisabati hata hivyo ilikuwa tofauti kwani ilimchosha sana mwalimu mpya wa hesabu.  Kiingereza kilimkatisha tamaa lakini bado ni sawa, alifurahia sana sayansi ya asili na masomo mengine yote.
P35	Bibi yake anamchukua mwishoni mwa siku ya shule (14:40).  Yuko nyumbani akitazama video za jinsi ya kushinda hofu yako pamoja na video za Caesar Milan akifikiri kwamba zingesaidia, tahadhari ya waharibifu, hawakufanya hivyo.
P36	Yuko nyumbani akitazama video za jinsi ya kushinda hofu yako pamoja na video za Caesar Milan akifikiri kwamba zingesaidia, tahadhari ya waharibifu, hawakufanya hivyo.  Yuko nyumbani na anafanya kazi fulani za nyumbani, wazazi wake.
P37	wanapomwita aje kwa chakula anachokula na anafurahia chakula na mazungumzo na familia yake, anapanda orofa na kutazama YouTube akiwa na mawazo ya kesho itabidi ukabiliane na hofu yako.
P38	Ni saa 6:40 na mvulana anajiandaa kwa ajili ya shule na moyo wake unadunda sana lakini anakumbuka kwamba anapaswa kuwa sawa kwa siku hiyo hadi mama wa rafiki yake amalize kazi kabla hatujaondoka.
P39	Kwa hiyo anatambua anapaswa kuzingatia yale yaliyo mbele na sio yale yatakayokuwa mbele yake.  Anaelekea shule bila wasiwasi, na kama alivyopanga alipumzika tu.
P40	Wakati wa mapumziko mpira ulicheza na baridi kwa sehemu kubwa.  Alipitia masomo yote na kufurahia zaidi zaidi kwa sababu ilikuwa wiki elekezi kwa hivyo ilikuwa rahisi sana na mara nyingi ilikuwa utangulizi.
P41	Ni kuelekea mwisho wa siku sasa, na mvulana na marafiki zake wanashuka kwenye gari wakiwa na mabegi na vitu vyao.  Wamekaa kando ya gari wakistarehe na kuongea wao kwa wao.  Mmoja wa marafiki anatoa pendekezo la kwenda kucheza kandanda.
P42	kando ya uwanja, bila la kufanya "kwanini isiwe hivyo."  Kwa hivyo wanaanza kushuka kucheza, wanaishia kufurahiya sana hadi kaka wa mvulana wa kuzaliwa anakuja na hatima inagonga.  Anatambua kwamba atake asipende lazima aondoke uwanjani.
P43	Wanaelekea kwenye gari, mapigo ya moyo yakaanza kwenda mbio zaidi na zaidi na kuendelea kwenda mbio.  Wanafika kwenye gari na kumuona mama rafiki yake akiwa kwenye gari anatusubiri huku tukipakia mabegi yetu kwenye gari na kuingia.
P44	Mara tukiwa wote kwenye gari tunaelekea, tulikuwa tukipiga kelele kwenye gari huku tukisikiliza muziki na kuzungumza nao.  kila mmoja.  Hii ilikuwa ya kufurahisha sana lakini yote yalizidi kuwa magumu (kwangu bila shaka) muziki uliposimama
P45	na gari lilipungua katikati ya barabara na nilijua kuwa tumefika.  Geti lilifunguliwa na kuhisi mwendo wa polepole huku tukigeuka kwenye kifuniko cha gari.  Mmoja alifungua mlango wa gari, marafiki zangu wakatoka na mvulana wa kuzaliwa pia.
P46	Nilitoka nje na niliita jina lake kwa hofu huku mbwa wakibweka.  Alisimama na kunitazama kwa kuchanganyikiwa na kuniuliza kuna nini na akagundua kuwa sikuwa na raha.  Nikasema, “Tafadhali funga mlango!”
P47	na alifanya. hivyo, nilikaa pale kwenye gari huku mama yake akitokwa na machozi hataki na hata kukataa kutoka kwenye gari lile. Nilikuwa pale kwa dakika moja au zaidi na mama yake alipendekeza kwamba tuondoke kwenye gari na kuwapuuza mbwa,
P48	kwa hiyo bila chaguo lingine nilifanya kwa sababu najua kwa kweli sikuwa na kukaa ndani ya gari tena.  Kwa hiyo nilishuka kwenye gari kwa kusitasita sana na kuanza kutembea taratibu kuelekea mlango wa mbele.
P49	Na nilipokelewa na mbwa mkubwa na wa kutisha karibu na mlango na wakati huo nilishtushwa sana na utulivu wa mbwa.  Nilitarajia mbwa watabweka na kuruka lakini hawakufanya hivyo.
P50	Bado nilikuwa naogopa sana mbwa.  Birthday boy alituambia kuwa alikuwa ameweka kubwa zaidi bafuni kwa hiyo nilitulia kidogo lakini ghafla nilimuona mbwa huyu na niseme niliogopa sana kwa sababu ya saizi kubwa ya mbwa huyu.
P51	Basi haikushangaza mapigo yangu ya moyo yakaanza kudunda tena kwa kasi sana huku mbwa akinisogelea ili kunisalimia, nilisimama palepale nikijaribu kupuuza.  Kwa hivyo sasa nilikuwa mtulivu na nikaona vijana wengine wakicheza pool.  Basi
P52	niliamua kwenda kucheza nao na napenda pool hivyo niliamua kujiunga na nikaburudika.  Nilijaribu kupuuza mbwa na katika kama dakika 10 nilikuwa sawa kabisa.  Baada ya dakika nyingine 5 nilikuwa tayari nikiwashika mbwa na hata yule ambaye
P53	ambaye awali nilikuwa namuogopa.  Tulikuwa tu tumerudi kutoka shuleni baada ya kukatishwa kucheza.  Kwa hiyo marafiki zangu wakasema “Gents twende tucheze mpira” tulichoka kwa hiyo tukasema “Kwa nini tusifanye hivyo”.
P54	Tulicheza kidogo na ilikuwa ya kufurahisha sana.  Rafiki yangu mmoja aliingia kwenye kinyesi cha mbwa, Mpira ulipigwa kwenye barabara mara mbili na muhimu zaidi nilifurahiya.
P55	Nadhani ikiwa una cynophobia au phobia ya urefu au hata hofu yoyote.  Wazo na pendekezo langu ni wewe kuruka ndani yake.  Niamini nilifikiri ilikuwa ni ujinga kwangu kushuka kwenye gari lakini nilifanya hivyo na sijutii kwa sekunde 1.
