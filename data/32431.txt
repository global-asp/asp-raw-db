page_text:

P1	Suddenly,the water started rising.
P2	Until we had no choice we had to leave.
P3	We had to leave our homes.
P4	Everything was washed away. Most thought there was no point in going back.
P5	But I knew it is my home and I can't leave it now.
P6	Once the water had gone down I convinced my family to come back.
P7	It took a while but we fixed the house and have lived there ever since.
