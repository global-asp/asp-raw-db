desc:	A dance contest brings fun and joy to all...and also tests a friendship.

page_text:

P1	I entered a dance contest with my friends. We put on our most beautiful dresses. I asked my mother,  "Can I take that scarf? I like it very much." Mother gave me the scarf. I was beautiful!
P2	On the showground,  there were many groups. All the girls wore colourful dresses. There was lively music. It made you want to dance. Everyone was very cheerful.
P3	Mothers,  grandmothers and aunts had made food that smells great.  It made us feel hungry! In the contest,  there were many prizes for all the groups that danced.  All the groups danced very well.
P4	The group of the oldest girls and boys won the contest. I said to my friends,  "Our group was the best! We were beautiful and danced very well. We should have won."
P5	Farida heard me and was upset. She was in another group. She thought they had danced better. We started arguing. She yanked my head scarf and ran away with it.
P6	It was the scarf that I borrowed from mother. I started to cry. My friends ran after Farida and brought the scarf back. I was very happy.
P7	I forgot to be angry with Farida. The music was lively and cheerful. My friends and I did not stop dancing. It was such a fun day.
P8	The next day early in the morning,  I went to the well to fetch water. Farida also went early to the well to fetch water. We spoke of how all the groups were beautiful and how the dances were lively.
P9	Both of us think that the dance contest should have lasted all weekend. We had already forgotten our anger. We were,  again,  good friends.
