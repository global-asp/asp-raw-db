P1	Once upon a time,  there lived a girl called Angel. She lived with her step mother and her sister called Josephine. They both lived in Kikuboo village and they both did not go to school. Angel was always sent every thing they needed while Josephine her sister was just doing nothing. One day,  Angel was sent to the market to buy some tomatoes. She looked for the tomatoes and they were no where to be found. As she delayed, her mother got more angrier because they both did not like her. By the time she arrived, it was already midnight. When she entered the house, her mother bet her and threw her out. As she was outside, a young man came and carried her up on a horse and took her to a nearby palace.
P2	The guard opened the gate while giving him respect. Angel did not no what was going on. What she didn't know is that the young man who was riding her was a prince and he was about to marry but he didn't have anyone to marry. Therefore he married her and they lived together happily as a couple. One Friday morning, they were attacked by a gang thieves. These thieves did not have any thing to steal but gold. They entered the palace with big bags. What Angel didn't know was that the prince was a great fighter and all the people feared him at fighting and that is why most people feared him and followed his orders. He killed the thieves and hanged them on ropes in the centre of the palace and all the people began to praise him for what he had done. All the people became happy again including the prince and the princes.
