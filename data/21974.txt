page_text:

P1	Many years ago, Sun and Water were great friends. Both lived on earth together.
P2	Sun used to visit Water very often, but Water never went to visit Sun.
P3	At last Sun asked Water why he never came to visit. 

Water replied that Sun's house was too small. "If I come with my family we will drive you out," he said.
P4	Then Water said, "If you wish me to visit you, build a very large compound. My people are very many, and take up a lot of room." 

Sun promised to build a very big compound.
P5	Sun returned home to his wife, Moon, who greeted him with a broad smile. Sun told Moon what he had promised Water.
P6	The next day he started building a huge compound in which to entertain his friend.
P7	As soon as the compound was completed, he asked Water to come and visit them.
P8	When Water arrived, he asked Sun whether it would be safe for him to enter.

"Yes, come in, my friend," Sun answered.
P9	Water began to flow in. 

He was accompanied by crocodiles, fish, frogs, snakes, snails, flukes, turtles, and all the water animals.
P10	Very soon Water was knee-deep. He asked Sun if it was still safe.

"Yes," Sun again answered. So more of water's people  came in.
P11	Water reached the level of the top of a person's head. He asked Sun, "Can more of my people come in?" Sun and Moon both answered, "Yes." 

Water flowed on, until Sun and Moon had to perch themselves on the top of the roof.
P12	Water's people continued to rush in. Very soon they reached the top of the roof. 

Sun and Moon were forced to go up into the sky. They have remained in the sky ever since.
