P1	This is Tom. He may look like an ordinary black and white cat, but in actual fact, he is quite extraordinary
P2	This is his little red scooter. Tom calls her his little "Love Bug."
P3	Tom is kind, caring, generous and exceptionally talented.
P4	Tom spends his days baking magnificant cakes and delivering them to family and friends who are feeling sad.
P5	Quick as a flash, Tom designs exquisite gowns made with great precision and detail.
P6	However Tom's greatest talent is not his cooking or sewing skills. Not even his astounding driving skills.
P7	No, his greatest skill is to fill someone's heart with love. Tom knows exactly when someone needs a friend.
P8	He drives right up to your door and comes to fill you empty space with his love
