page_text:

P1	There is an NGO that goes by the name P.U.S.H which stands for…@@P – Persevere@U – Until@S – Something@H – Happens
P2	After school many kids go to PUSH where we all get food, we are assisted with homework, after eating and homework we play lots of fun games with the teachers at the centre. I have a lot of friends at the centre and that's where I met my best friend Jayden.
P3	Before Jayden and I became friends Jayden was an angry boy, he always fought with the other kids and when he wasn't fighting he would tease the other kids. None of the kids liked playing with Jayden.
P4	The owner of PUSH Mam Lorna heard Jayden being nasty to the other kids and how he was teasing them, she called him and said my child don't be nasty it's not very nice to tease the other children.
P5	Why are you being mean to them? Jayden looked at her and said Mam Lorna I don't have any friends here none of these kids want to play with me.
P6	Mam Lorna gave him a hug and said my boy if you are friendlier to the other kids and stop teasing them they would play with you.
P7	A few weeks later was Jayden's birthday as he walked in the centre he saw a big balloon with his name on it and the place was decorated and as he got closer he saw a cake with his name on it too, finally when he was close enough everyone there started singing happy birthday to him.
P8	Jayden couldn't believe his eyes nor could he stop smiling, Mam Lorna then said to him here at PUSH we all LOVE one another and we all care for one another. We all love and care for you.
P9	Jayden was still in shock by what he saw and heard the boy couldn't utter a word he just started crying. Everyone wished him a happy birthday. This made Jayden very happy, we played had cake and everyone had a good time.
P10	The next day Jayden came to the centre a totally different kid, he didn't teased anyone nor was he being mean to anyone. Jayden is much happier at PUSH and now he has a lot of friends.
