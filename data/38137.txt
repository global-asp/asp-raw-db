P1	So one morning me and Yoshi were having a nice day together. We were going out for a walk in the forest. Until something unexpeted happend. We fell in mud. We tried to pull our feet out. But they wont budge.
P2	That means we just fell in in cold deep quicksand. Yoshi tried to save me. He said don't worry buddy i got you. He wraped his arms around me and we sank even more.@Yoshi and i looked at each other. We were so scared we did not say anything.
P3	Quicksand was already up to our neckes. Yoshi said to me saying: Oh Derek Derek Derek. How the hell are we going to get out of here? I replied i don't know. I thought of a plan. I told Yoshi. Here was the plan. We had to find a branch.
P4	I was still looking for one. But however Yoshi was being a good friend. He found a branch for the both  of us. He siad to me Derek grab on. Yoshi wraped his arm around me to help get me out.@But the branch broke.
P5	Yoshi said to me and said: Ok lets try to relax and calm down here. Agreed i said. And so we did. The quicksand was still up to our necks. We could see the fear in each others eyes.@Yoshi said to himself. Why did we come here? why?
P6	It was around 6:00 P.M. it was geting dark out. We were still stuck in quicksand. It was still up to our necks. I said to Yoshi i'm so scared. I know i am scared to Yoshi said. But were gonna get through this.@We just have to relax.
P7	I fell asleep. Yoshi was awake trying to figure something out. But he did. He found this thick branch. He founf it and gasped. Yoshi woke me up. He said Derek wake up.@And so i did. Yoshi said to me grab on   @To that branch. So i did.
P8	Yoshi again wraped his arm around me. He was doing it to help me get out. Even him. But only Yoshi got out. He was coverd in quicksand. I was still in it. Ok give me your hand buddy.   Weres your arm? Yoshi asked. Right here i said.
P9	I gave Yoshi my arm and my hand. He  pulled me out. And it was accomplished. We did it. As soon as i got out. Yoshi said to me and said with fear Derek are you ok? Yoshi said with a fearful look on his face. @I'm good don't worry.
P10	Yoshi was happy i was ok. Then Yoshi and i gave eachother a hug. And then we went home happily ever after.@@The end.
