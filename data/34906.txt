P1	Dedication
P2	Once a puppy named Rufus @@It was white and fluffy with long, beautiful ears @@Rufus belonged to Ifeoma but a lot of kids wanted to play with it.@@But, only Ifeoma could choose who got to play with Rufus
P3	One day, Ifeoma was playing with Rufus and Ayo wanted to play too.@@"may I play with Rufus a little?"  Ayo asked @@"NO!" Ifeoma said, @@"ok, maybe I'll come back later," Ayo said as he skipped away
P4	It was a sunny day and Ayo saw Ifeoma playing with Rufus  @@"hello Ifeoma, may I take Rufus for a walk?" @@"yes," said Ifeoma @@As Ayo started walking away happy with the puppy, @Ifeoma yelled, "Ayo Bring him back!"
P5	"But you said I should play with him," Ayo said sadly @@"Yes, but I want to play with Rufus now," said Ifeoma @@Ayo had no choice but to return the puppy to Ifeoma
P6	"Mummy, Ifeoma said I could play with Rufus today but she took him back" Ayo said to his mother that night @@"Well, Darling, the puppy belongs to Ifeoma, she determines who plays with it" his mother replied.
P7	The next day, Ayo saw Ifeoma and her puppy sleeping on the balcony.@@He walked closer and whispered "Ifeoma, can I play with your puppy?" @@But Ifeoma was fast asleep and didn't respond @@Ayo was tempted to take rufus but he decided to wait until Ifeoma wakes up.
P8	As Ayo walked away Ifeoma and her puppy woke up from their slumber @@"hello Ayo, do you want to play with Rufus?" Ifeoma said@ @"Yes! ", replied an excited Ayo
P9	"ok, we can play with him together," said Ifeoma @Ayo was very excited and brought out all his treats and gave to Rufus.@@Ayo and Ifeoma played with Rufus all-day@@They all went home tired but very happy.
