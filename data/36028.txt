P1	What do you see in this picture? @@There is a small motor boat sailing on the sea. @@Those people on board are going to dive. They will be diving under the surface of the sea.@@They will visit the world under water.
P2	They are preparing to dive. @@They need to carry tanks with oxygen in order to breathe while they are diving.@ @Oxygen tanks and other special equipment will help them to breathe while they swim under water. @@Are you ready to dive with them?
P3	Our friends have dived below the surface of the ocean. Can you see the boat above them?@@They wore swimming goggles to prevent water from getting in their eyes. The goggles help them to see clearly under water.
P4	Look! It's amazing what you can see under the water! @@Look at the patterns and colours of the different fishes around the corals.@@Look at the many shapes of the corals. @@Corals are also a type of animal, although they look more like plants.
P5	The divers are very careful of this spiny fish! They don't swim near to it.@@It is very dangerous. The spines on this fish are poisonous.@@What else can you see in this picture?
P6	Look very carefully at the middle of this picture.@@There is something hiding there. It is an octopus. It blends in with the colours and shapes around it. @@Look at the next page to see the octopus swimming.
P7	These fish are sharks. Some types of sharks will eat humans, but not this type!@@This type of shark is harmless. The divers swim near the sharks. @@It is nearly time to head back to the boat. The oxygen tanks are running low on oxygen.
P8	For a while, the divers swim along with a turtle.@@Then the turtle decides to eat a sea sponge for lunch. @@The divers continue on their way to the boat, which is waiting for them where they first dived into the water.
P9	Look at these bright striped fish! Be careful of the anemone where the fish live.@@Anemones can sting us with their poisonous tentacles. But a human touch is also harmful to an anemone!
P10	Our friends have reached the boat. They will return to the surface of the water.@@Can you see the ripples in the water from the boat far above them?@@It is time to leave this underwater world. Our dive has come to an end.
P11	That dive was wonderful!
