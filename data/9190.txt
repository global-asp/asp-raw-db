page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived two friends,  Tortoise and Snake.
P2	On day Tortoise said to Snake,  "Let us go and swim." "Alright,  but I don't know to swim," answered Snake. "I will teach you," replied Tortoise.
P3	They went to a swimming pool. "Who will enter the water first?" asked Tortoise. "You will,  and I will watch you," said Snake.
P4	Tortoise entered the swimming pool. Snake observed from the steps.
P5	After some time,  Snake entered the pool as Tortoise gave instructions.
P6	Tortoise and Snake swam in the shallow end of the pool.
P7	They started floating on the water.
P8	As they were floating,  Tortoise started swimming backstroke. While imitating Tortoise,  Snake could not propel himself and started drowning.
P9	On realising that Snake had disappeared,  Tortoise hurriedly went under water and rescued the life of the snake.
P10	As soon as Tortoise got out of the water,  he turned Snake upside-down in order to get rid of the water that Snake swallowed.
P11	Finally,  Tortoise used the mouth-to-mouth method to remove more water.
