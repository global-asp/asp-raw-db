page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  a man had two goats; he used to keep them in a goat house and shut the door every evening. In the morning,  he opened the door and took them to graze. He used to tether them where there was not enough grass.
P2	The goats never had enough to eat. One night,  the goats discussed how to open the door and get out to find food. One goat found a way of opening the door. They went out and ate potato vines belonging to the home. After eating,  they went back to the goat house and shut the door.
P3	In the morning,  the man discovered that his vines had been eaten by some animals. He suspected his neighbour's goats. That night,  his goats opened the door again and ate more vines.
P4	The following morning,  the man found the vines eaten. He was upset. He planned to check on his vines that night. In the middle of the night,  he came out with a spear. He tiptoed towards the goats,  aimed and threw the spear.
P5	One goat was speared and the other ran away. The man went back to the house. In the morning,  he went to check on what he had speared,  only to find out that he had speared his own goat. He was very sorry.
