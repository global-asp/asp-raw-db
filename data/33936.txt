page_text:

P1	These are my beautiful hands. They work together very well and wash each other. @@They are like two wonderful, best friends. When one is hurt, the other one is there to help heal. They make such a great team.
P2	Like very good close friends, when one is dirty, the other one is there to wash the other.@@When one is dry, the other one is always there to soften the other. Like loving friends do, they are always there for each other.
P3	They work like a team. The left hand holds a box of matches and the right hand does the lighting, sometimes it gets hurt.@@The right hand gets to do a lot of the tests.
P4	When food is cooked, both hands do a fantastic job together as a team. When cutting or peeling fruits and vegetables, the left hand always does the holding and gets injured as it n gets a chance to cut or chop as the right hand always does.
P5	The right hand is always there to help the left one to get better and heal. It cleans, apply ointment and dresses the left hand and makes sure that gems stay away.
P6	The right hand gives the left hand all the attention it needs to get better and heal.@@During these times, the left hand gets the most attention and gets well taken care of until it heals completely.
P7	Like two supportive, loving and caring friends, my beautiful hands always look out for each other.@@They are inseparable in spite of all the pain the right hand inflicts on the left hand. And of course, none of it is intentional.
