page_text:

P1	Long ago, Ugali and Fish lived together in a village. 

They grew to become close friends.
P2	One day, Fish asked Ugali to accompany him to the lake for a swim.

Together, they headed for the lake.
P3	When they arrived on the shore of the lake, Fish said to Ugali, "Let me jump in first." He dived into the lake.
P4	After swimming for a while, Fish said to Ugali, "Now, it is your turn to swim."

Ugali answered, "I cannot swim. If I dive in like you, I will drown and dissolve."
P5	Fish persuaded Ugali saying, "Please try. You won't dissolve and if you drown, I'll rescue you." So, Ugali agreed to try.

Ugali was unable to float. He called Fish, "Please, come and rescue me," but Fish did not rescue him.
P6	Man heard Fish complaining about not being able to rescue Ugali. Man asked, "What is the problem?"

Fish explained, "This stupid Ugali dived into the water and now he is drowning." Man rescued Ugali.
P7	When Ugali came out of the water, he said, "Fish is not a good friend. He persuaded me to swim and yet I don't know how to do so."

Man said, "Let me resolve this problem." He sliced up Ugali and Fish and enjoyed eating them together. And that was the end of their conflict.
