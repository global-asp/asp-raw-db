page_text:

P1	In a village full of shacks and only one built with bricks. There lived a little boy named Nido.
P2	Nido and his parents lived in a big house. The only brick house in our village. The rest of the village had small little shacks.
P3	Nido was selfish and cruel. He would never play the games his friends wanted to play. So they always played games Nido liked.
P4	Nido always had the best of everything in our village. He had the coolest toys, the latest technology and only wore name brand clothes. He would brag about what he had and made his friends feel bad for not having what he had.
P5	Nido's mom and dad were always busy with work and they were hardly ever home. Nido would always invite friends over but they weren't allowed to touch or play with his toys.
P6	This frustrated his friends because they were always sharing whatever they had with him and made him play with their toys.
P7	Nido's friends left angry and rode off with their bicycles. This made Nido sad and angry because he was left all alone in a big empty house.
P8	Nido's birthday was coming up and he was excited, his mom said he can invite as many friends as he wanted too. Nido then invited all of his friends and told them all the fun things they were going to do, they would have two jumping castles, a photo booth, a cotton candy machine, a pop-corn machine, a chocolate fountain and loads more.
P9	Finally the day arrived, it's Nido's birthday. All the things were there just like Nido said it would be. Hours had passed and no one showed up for his birthday celebration. Nido went to his room and spent the rest of the day crying.
P10	Nido asked his friends why none of them showed up for his birthday celebration and they told him that he was selfish and they weren't going to attend his party and watch him have fun all by himself. Nido then apologized to all of his friends and promised never to be selfish again.
