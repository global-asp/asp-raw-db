P1	In the beginning there was happiness upon the villagers.
P2	They farmed, built and enjoyed themselves
P3	Then there was a family, the dad’s name was John, the mom’s name was Janeth, and the son’s name was Peter.
P4	They just moved into the village, so they started to build their house.
P5	They built a very big house, even the villagers laughed at them, but they did not care.
P6	One night there was heavy rain and the villagers’ houses were taken away and they had no place to go, except for John’s house.
P7	They went and apologized to them and lived happily ever after.
