page_text:

P1	My name is Angel and I am eight years old. I have a beautiful tiny body
P2	My mom taught me that my body is private. Nobody is allowed to touch it but me.
P3	I have a head, shoulders, knees and toes. Other parts I have are not in open view. Meaning that they are hidden. I call them my private part.
P4	Mom and dad once told me that I was their little princess and if someone hurt me to always tell them.
P5	One day when we were visiting my grand parents house, my uncle came into the the bedroom I was playing in. He hugged and touched me in one of the places that is hidden. I got so scared and just stood where I was.
P6	I thought: @This is my private part! Why did he do that?
P7	He said we should keep it our little secret and I shouldn't tell anyone. But, I remembered what my parents had told me. I ran out of the room and I yelled Mom! Dad!
P8	I told mom and dad what had taken place. They said they were proud I told them right away.
P9	They believed what I told them. When they went to the bedroom, my uncle was no longer there. He ran away.
P10	I was so glad I remembered what my mom taught me.
P11	This is my body and it belongs to me.@@@                                       The end!
