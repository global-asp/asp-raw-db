page_text:

P1	Long time ago, when fish had no colours, there was one fish named Pono. Its name means vision. @@Pono lived with other fish in the sea next to South Africa.
P2	One day, Pono lifted its head out of the water. @@The fish saw the rainbow with beautiful colours.@@Pono liked the rainbow colours.
P3	Pono greeted the rainbow and said, "You are so beautiful with your bright colours. Please would you share your colours with me?"@@The rainbow was happy and thanked the fish for the praising words.
P4	The rainbow replied, "I will share my colours with you and then you will be a rainbow too. I know we are going to be good friends." @@The rainbow blew on Pono and all the colours spread to the fish.
P5	Pono was very happy to see its body with beautiful colours, looking like a rainbow. The fish thanked its friend.
P6	Pono swam back under the water. All the fish were surprised to see Pono with beautiful rainbow colours on its body. @@The other fish gathered around Pono, who told them what happened.
P7	The other fish asked if the rainbow could also share its colours with them. @@Pono told them that the rainbow was kind and helpful.@@All the fish lifted their heads out of the water to talk to the rainbow.
P8	The rainbow asked each fish to choose its colours.@The rainbow blew on the fish, and they became colourful. @@"Thank you, rainbow!" called the fish.@@And this is how fish came to have colours on their bodies.
