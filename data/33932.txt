page_text:

P1	Amara walked through the park. @@The trees in the park were green and healthy. @@But, there was one tree that was brown and dry.
P2	"I need to water this tree," said Amara to herself.@@She watered the tree and it quickly came to life.@@It grew into a big, magnificent green tree.
P3	Then, the tree spoke. @@"You watered me and brought me back to life," said the tree.@@"I'm a magic tree, I shall grant you three wishes."
P4	Amara made her first wish.@@"I wish for a red bicycle," she said cautiously.@@Abracadabra! A red bicycle appeared.
P5	She made her second wish after thinking for a few moments.@@"I wish for a small radio," said Amara. @@Abracadabra! A small radio appeared.
P6	Amara made her third wish.@@"I wish for pink crystal earrings," she said happily.@@Abracadabra! Pink crystal earrings appeared.
P7	The magic tree said, "You have everything that you wanted."@@Amara smiled, "Yes I do, but those things were not for me." @@The magic tree was confused.
P8	Amara explained, "The bicycle is for my older brother. He outgrew his bicycle." @@"The radio is for Dad. His radio broke. The earrings are for Mum. She loves fancy earrings."@@"And they will all share with me!"
