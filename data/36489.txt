page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in a far away village was a young girl named Alex. Alex loved to herd her grandfather's little calf. One afternoon when Alex was watching the calf eating grass; a hungry wolf spotted them.
P2	The wolf hid behind a small bush. When the Alex was not looking, the wolf snuck up on her to try to catch her. But lucky for Alex, just as the wolf got closer to her; a storm started.  Rain and wind so strong that the wolf could not see or walk properly. Alex looked behind and saw the wolf trying to get her.
P3	Alex and the calf managed to run away from the wolf and got home. The next day the wolf went into the village with some fresh grass from the river bank. He made a trail of grass from the cattle kraal to the nearby bush where he hid himself. When little calf woke up, she saw the grass and started eating it following the trail.
P4	Before she knew it, little calf was alone in the forest. Meanwhile at home, Alex had gone to the kraal to take little calf out for her morning snack at the river bank but little calf was not there. Alex took a big Bull, Alex's father and they followed the trail.
P5	Alex and the bull arrived at the bush just as the wolf was about to take a big bite on little calf. The bull jumped on the wolf and hit him with  his big strong horns. The wolf ran away, never to be seen ever ever again. Alex, little calf and the bull went home and they all lived happily ever after.@@....the end...
