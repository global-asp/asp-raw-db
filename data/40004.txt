page_text:

P1	In the bush, Lion Shiva fell asleep, his big head resting on his paws. @@A small Mouse Mimi unexpectedly approached Shiva. In her effort to run she bumped over the lion's face.
P2	Shiva woke from his sleep and violently laid his big paw on Mimi, aiming to kill her.@The miserable Mimi cried, "Spare me!" "Please let me go; I'll pay you back someday."@@Shiva found it very funny to believe that small Mimi could ever be of help. However, he was kind and eventually let the Mimi go.
P3	After a few days, Shiva was trapped in a hunter's net as he was chasing his prey in the forest.
P4	Shiva was unable to release himself, and his furious roaring filled the jungle.@@Shiva was battling in the net when Mimi, who recognized the voice, arrived.
P5	Mimi quickly ran to one of the large ropes holding Shiva and began to chew it. Eventually, the rope loosened, releasing the Shiva.
P6	Mimi said: "You laughed when I said I would pay you back. Now you understand that a Mouse can assist a Lion.
P7	Shiva sincerely respected Mimi, and the two eventually became close friends.
