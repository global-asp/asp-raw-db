page_text:

P1	One Friday morning, I woke up very early, made my bed then headed to take a bath. Afterwards, I went downstairs to take my breakfast that mother had made.
P2	My mother after realizing the bright smile on my face asked, " what is special today! Your face look very bright and excited?" I answered, "today is our school's cultural day." I requested her to give me fifty shillings for a photo.
P3	Later, my mother dropped my brother and I to school. We took our bags to class and proceeded to the dinning hall where the cultural event was taking place. Our class was performing mwomboko dances .
P4	Outside the hall business, people were selling items like necklaces, bracelets and rings all from different cultures. The available traditional food was very delicious. During the event a mysterious thing happened.
P5	After performance, I was singled out to be the best. I was awarded five hundred shillings which I used to buy my parents each a bracelet. When I reached home, I found my parents and my sister waiting for me anxiously.
P6	I  wondered why they were waiting for me that long. I told them how I emerged as the best traditional dancer and was awarded 500 shillings. My mother was so happy to hear that and she begun preparing delecious meals for making her proud.
P7	After the meal, my mother blindfolded me to the sitting room and requested me to sit. She unblindfolded me and to my surprise the room was decorated with ribbons and very colourful balloons.
P8	I was overjoyed by what I saw. My father presented me with a wrapped box full of presents, my mother and sister gave me two wrapped boxes containing nice clothes,three storybooks and dresses.The day was very exciting.
