page_text:

P1	Near Sinyare village, lived a big snake called Lego.
P2	Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went for firewood. Grandma said, “Remember Lego."
P3	The girls prepared some food. It would be a long day.
P4	Apiyo said, “Let’s be quiet. Lego lives near here.”
P5	Atieno wanted Lego’s teeth. Apiyo said, “Remember grandma's warning.”
P6	Ajoh did not care. “I want Lego’s golden teeth,” she said.
P7	Lego did not find his golden teeth. 

He hid and waited.
P8	The girls heard, “Hssssss!” Lego was ready to bite the thief.
P9	Lego said, “The thief will not pass my test.”
P10	Apiyo and Atieno sang very well. They passed the test.
P11	Ajoh could not sing properly. Lego knew who the thief was.
P12	Lego swallowed Ajoh! 

Grandma said, “If only she had listened to me.”
