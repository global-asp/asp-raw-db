page_text:

P1	Baboon and Crocodile were best friends. They were playing together. They ate together. They did everything together.
P2	But one day, Crocodile got so sick that he was almost dead. When he saw that his illness was getting worse, Crocodile went to the charlatan who told him, "If you want to get better, you have to eat baboon meat."
P3	Crocodile was sad to hear that. But there was no other choice to cure himself than to eat his friend the baboon.
P4	When Baboon went to see his friend, Crocodile put him on his back and took him to the deepest place in the river.
P5	Crocodile said, "The quack told me I had to eat you to get cured, my friend."
P6	So, Baboon replied, "No, my friend. Don't eat me. I'm too small. Wait a moment and I'll call my grandfather. He's bigger than me. Eat him and you'll be satisfied. "
P7	So Crocodile said, "Where is your grandfather?" Baboon said to him: "He is in this tree, on this island." Crocodile said, "Go get it so I can eat it."
P8	Baboon jumped off Crocodile's back, quickly climbed to the top of the tree and stayed there. Crocodile waited and waited. But he didn't see the slightest sign of Baboon. And that's how they got angry.
