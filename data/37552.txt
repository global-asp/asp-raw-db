page_text:

P1	Up and down I walk but,I can’t seem to find my mommy or daddy.Searching high and low.Calling out to them but all I see is creatures not like me.
P2	Wondering around I came across a monkey not knowing who I am.Why are you hairless mister bear? With tears in his eyes he said I don’t belong.Do not fear be brave you are different be you said monkey.
P3	Why is fitting in so hard I’m destroying myself for not loving myself.Ohh good morning lady bug you are so beautiful I wish I could look like you.Never say such thing bear we all are made in our own special way.
P4	All by my self with no hair no family.I don’t belong in this world why are you crying bear asked Hippo. I don’t belong sir I have no family and no hair.Well you see in the jungle we all are family don’t worry be happy son.
P5	Who dares to be weeping in my jungle a deep voice out of the sky appears to be the great wise owl.Listen closely now Bear do not fear the future be brave no one looks like you in this jungle embrace that.Life challenges us to make us strong
P6	Bear accepted who he was and embraced himself everyday. You are the best at being you he said.
