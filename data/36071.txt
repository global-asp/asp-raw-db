page_text:

P1	The battle-weary king led his tired followers to settle on the sandy dunes of the Cape Flats.@@Majestic Table Mountain tried to protect them from the harsh weather as best she could.
P2	The king's subjects complained bitterly about their new home.@@They could not bear the scorching summers nor the cold, wet winters. They could not bear the stinging sand and howling wind.
P3	Fynbos and Rooibos were the king's trusted advisors. One day, they approached their king.@@"Everyone suffers living under these difficult conditions. Can we move to a place where life will be easier?" they asked.
P4	King Protea smiled at his advisors and spoke in a gentle voice. @@"You are loyal and I hear your concerns. However, this is our home. Together we can overcome any difficulty," said the king.
P5	The sun beat down on the kingdom of the Cape Flats. The heat was relentless. A wildfire broke out. @@Furious winds fanned the raging fire. The flames crept across King Protea's kingdom, destroying everything.
P6	When the fire finally died, it left behind a sad sight that stretched from Hoerikwaggo across the Cape Flats.@@The landscape lay bare for months. The seasons changed, as seasons do. Winter rains pelted the earth.
P7	Unknown to all, something miraculous was happening under the soil. The seeds that survived the wildfire burst open, ready to grow.@@With incredible strength, the seedlings grew up towards the light and revealed colourful buds.
P8	The landscape was once again decorated with regal proteas, resilient fynbos and healing rooibos.@@Plants in the Cape Floral Kingdom continue to thrive in the extreme conditions of the Cape Flats.
