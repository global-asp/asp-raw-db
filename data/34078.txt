page_text:

P1	Flytina loves to fly in the sky, whether the sky is blue, cloudy or dark. @@She likes to flap her wings and gently flutter around and away. @@It is her favorite thing to do.
P2	Jubril the leopard loves sitting on tree branches. He is always frowning too. @@He loves to pretend he is king while wearing his yellow, red and blue hat.  @@His pretend sceptre looks like a bubble wand.
P3	Meow the cat and Red the rooster are talking about the clouds and wondering if it would rain. @@They were also wondering where Jubril the leopard  and Flytina had gone again.
P4	Ronti the dog joined Red the rooster and Meow the cat. @@He thought it would rain too. @@But why do you think he is drooling?
P5	Brown the horse joined them. "Where is Jubril the leopard and Flytina the butterfly?" He was sad.@@The friends were used to them disappearing. @@But they decided to search for their friends along with worried Brown.
P6	They climbed up and down the hills. They looked around the pond. They went to the cave, called out their names, but no one answered. @@Tired and hungry, they paused to look at the beautiful starry night. Then they went home.
P7	Brown the horse, Red the rooster, Meow the cat and Ronti the dog prepared to have dinner. @@The meal was supposed to be fun but because they were now all sad, it was the most boring meal ever!
