desc:	A story about what happens to an old woman when she goes to visit her daughter on the other side of the river.

page_text:

P1	Long ago there was an old woman who was a very good farmer. 

Her daughter got married to a man who lived on the other side of the river.
P2	The old woman put some cassava, beans and yams in a small basket. She was taking it to her daughter and son-in-law.
P3	After she had crossed the river, a strange voice shouted, “Put down your basket!”

The old woman asked, “Who are you?”
P4	The voice answered, “I am the king of the forest. I give people fever and stomach-ache. I make them shiver and shake.” 

Frightened, the old woman threw down the basket and ran.
P5	When she reached her son-in-law, she told him about the frightening voice.

Her son-in-law said, “Next time you come to visit us, take your big basket, and put your dog inside.”
P6	A week later, the old woman took her big basket to visit her daughter and son-in-law.  

After she had crossed the river, the same voice said, “Put down your basket! I am the king of the forest. I give people fever and stomach-ache. I make them shiver and shake!”
P7	She put down the basket, hurried on and watched from a distance to see what would happen. 

Out came the creature from under the bridge. It was only a small hare!

Eagerly, the hare took off the lid of the basket.
P8	Out jumped a very angry dog!    

That was the end of the hare.
