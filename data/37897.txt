page_text:

P1	Today is summer! We are celebrating summer with a party. I want to make a  fire, so I tell my mom and dad and go to the forest.
P2	I got hurt in the forest! I came home crying. I hurt my leg a lot. My grandmother and grandfather told my its ok. So I went back to get the wood.
P3	On the way, I saw a really tall tree! I thought I should climb up it! I am a good climber anyway, so I did! But...
P4	I couldn't come down! I was so scared! My cousin Lilyana, came to check on me. "Julie, what happened? Get down from the tree! I'm here to help you get wood." "I cant " I say. "I cant get down! Its too high!" I say.
P5	"You can do it! I believe in you Julie!" Lilyana says.  "Your right. I can do it! " I say. "Thats the spirit! Come on!" Lilyana says in joy. "Here I come! I can do this! I am brave!" I say
P6	"Yay!" We both say! "I came down! I did it! What a relief!" I say. "Now we can collect some wood for the fire! And I'm so happy your okay! It is a relief!!!" Lilyana says. "You know what else is? A SUMMER PARTY!" I say.
P7	we came home and were so happy! Then we all said..... PARTY TIME!
