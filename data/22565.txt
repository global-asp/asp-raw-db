page_text:

P1	In a particular year, the dry season was too long and a drought hit hard. As a result, all the rivers dried up, except the River of Blessings. 

All the animals were thirsty and called for a meeting.
P2	Camel was the first to speak, "As you know, we are very thirsty and all the rivers have dried up, except the River of Blessings. But it is very far away. What do we do?"
P3	Horse suggested, "Some of us can go to the River of Blessings. We can drink and bring water for the others." 

Cow answered, "It is too far. By the time we returned from the river those left behind would be dead."
P4	Sheep said, "Maa! Maaa! I will go to the River of Blessings and drink water." 

Goat jumped up and said, "Meee, meee! I will also go to the River of Blessings." 

Chicken said, "Keer, ker ker ker! I too will go to the River of Blessings.
P5	All the animals wanted to go. Camel led the way. 

Going there was not easy. Guinea fowl was last in the line. "My friends, I can no longer go to the River of Blessings," he said.

Chicken swallowed Guinea fowl.
P6	They continued. Chicken said, "Please, I am tired, I no longer want to go to the River of Blessings." 

Sheep swallowed Chicken.
P7	As the journey continued, Sheep also became tired. 

Sheep said, "I am tired. I do not want to go to the River of Blessings anymore." 

Goat swallowed Sheep.
P8	Soon, Goat was too tired to continue going to the river. Horse turned and swallowed Goat. 

When Horse became too tired to go to the river, Cow swallowed him.
P9	When Cow finally could not continue, Camel turned and swallowed her.
P10	Being the only animal left, Camel did her best to reach the River of Blessings. 

Camel finally arrived, very tired.
P11	On arrival, Camel lay down and vomited Cow. 

Cow vomited Horse. Horse vomited Goat. 

Goat vomited Sheep. Sheep vomited Chicken and Chicken vomited Guinea fowl.
P12	And that is how all the animals managed to drink water from the River of Blessings.
