page_text:

P1	Go outside and look at a tree.@Name three colours on it you can see.@@Take a deep slow breath, in and out.
P2	Run your fingers gently on the tree bark@How does it feel@@What sounds does the tree make?@Does it shout or whisper or does it squeel?@@It's silent unless the wind dances with leaves. Then it whooshs side to side but never leaves.
P3	Take a deep slow breath in and out. @The tree gives us oxygen to breath, @Shade to keep cool underneath and@Fruits to eat. @@They also teach us how to be calm and still.@Say thanks to the Creator for the trees@We are grateful and pleased
