page_text:

P1	Long time ago,  Hyena and Hare were great friends. They were both poor but Hare owned a donkey. He also had a very small basin,  which he used to feed the donkey.
P2	One hot afternoon,  Hare decided to give water to his donkey. However,  Hare could not fetch water from the well with his small basin. So he decided to borrow a bigger basin from Hyena. Hyena gave Hare his basin because of their friendship.
P3	After getting water and giving it to the donkey,  Hare went home with Hyena's basin. Two weeks later,  Hyena wanted to wash clothes but Hare still had his basin. Hyena left the clothes and went to Hare's house for his basin.
P4	Hare gave Hyena his large basin. He also gave Hyena a small basin. Hare said,  "Your basin gave birth to a young one and since we are friends,  I am giving you the two of them." Hyena was happy and accepted the two basins.
P5	A few days later,  Hare wanted to water his donkey and again he went to Hyena for help. Hyena thought,  "Since I will get an extra basin,  I will give him my basin straight away!"Â  Hare took Hyena's big basin and went to water his donkey. Afterwards he took Hyena's basin home with him.
P6	Hyena waited to collect his basin from Hare. He wanted to give it time to give birth to a young one! When Hyena went to Hare's home to collect his basin,  Hare said,  "Hyena,  my friend,  I was just about to come to deliver the bad news. Your basin died two days ago. You know that all things that live,  also die!"
P7	Hyena could not believe this news. He said,  "I must call bigger animals to judge the case." So Hyena called the bigger animals for a meeting. Elephants,  buffalos,  hippos and giraffes arrived at Hare's home to judge the case.
P8	Hare was asked to explain what happened. He said,  "The first time I borrowed Hyena's basin,  it gave birth to a young one and I gave him the two. Unfortunately,  the second time I borrowed Hyena's basin,  it died before giving birth. You see,  whatever has life also dies. That's what happened to the basin!" All the animals agreed with Hare's explanation. Hyena lost his basin to Hare.
