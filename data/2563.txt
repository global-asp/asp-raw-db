desc:	A young boy finds and shoots a Hornbill. He gives the dead bird to an old man in the village

page_text:

P1	As I was moving in Buŋaanga village I found a fat hornbill.
P2	When I struck it with a catapult,  it shouted "ŋaa,  ŋaa,  ŋa!"
P3	The hornbill flew into the air. But I ran after it through the grass.
P4	Until it perched on a dead tree. Then I shot it again. This time it fell to the ground.
P5	I picked up the hornbill.
P6	And I gave it to Hiryagaana: one who eats whatever he finds. (One time,  I gave him Namupongera.) He happily received the hornbill.
P7	The head of the hornbill was very big and as hard as a panga or machete.
P8	The bird had fat like that of a sheep. It was so appetising!
P9	It's not easy to find a hornbill without planning. At night,  hornbills roost on dry branches. A person eats what he likes. That is why Hiryagaana eats hornbills.
