P1	*SECTION* — MULTIPLYING AND TABLES@@Prerequisite: Comfort with single-digit multiplication@@GAME — 3 IN A ROW@@Use a deck of cards with Q's (as 0's), A's (as 1's), and 2-9, or use four sets of Number Cards from 0 to 9. Use a 4 by 5 grid on a paper with 20 spaces randomly filled out with multiples of 5 and 10. Have a set of tokens for each player. Select a random card and put your token on that number times 5 or 10 - your choice. Once occupied, the other player cannot move there. The first player to get 3 in a row wins. @@The numbers 5 and 10 can be replaced by other pairs such as 2 and 4, or 3 and 6. These pairings help with practicing doubling strategies for multiplication. For example, if the player does not know 6 x 7, they can double 3 x 7.
P2	GAME — WAR — MULTIPLICATION@@Remove the picture cards from a deck and split it evenly between two players. To give more focused practice, remove the A's and 10's as well.@@Each player turns over two cards, multiplies them, and the player with the larger product wins those four cards. If the products are equal, two more cards are turned over and the winner gets to keep all eight cards. The player with the most cards after playing for a set time is the winner.@@GAME — BEEP@@Start by identifying a group of numbers to use for the round. It can be odd numbers, or multiples of 3 together with numbers that have a 3 in them, or any group that provides good practice.@@Two or more players take turns saying the numbers starting at 1. When a player has a number in the group, they must say "beep." If they fail to say beep, or say beep for a wrong number, they're out. The last player in wins!
P3	PUZZLE — TURNING THE TABLES@@Filling in a standard multiplication table is boring, and children quickly realize they can do it using addition rather than multiplication. To really practice multiplication, as well as practicing problem solving and factoring, create a mixed-up multiplication table.@@Move the rows and columns around, and leave out most of the headings and  entries in the middle. Here is an example using headings of 2 through 9.@@Solve this by starting with distinctive entries. The 20 forces its row to be multiplying by 4, and then the 36 makes its column be 9. The 49 forces its column and row to be 7. The 9 forces its column and row to be 3. Now the 12 must be in the column for 4. Continue the detective work in this way and fill in the entries as the headings are discovered.
P4	*SECTION* — RECTANGLE AREA@@Prerequisite: Comfort with single-digit multiplication and double-digit addition@@— INTRODUCTION —@@The area of a rectangle is its length times its width. That dry statement can be made tangible to your child in at least two ways. The first is to show a rectangle broken into a collection of squares. The second is to use number shapes to show how a quantity, such as 12, can be placed into an array - 3 by 4, 2 by 6, or 1 by 12. Playing with rectangle areas gives us a fun arena in which to play around with multiplication and factoring!
P5	INVESTIGATION — NUMBER SHAPES REVISITED@@Start with a large collection of small objects, such as raisins. For each number, investigate which rectangles you can make with that many objects. 1 can only be made with a 1 by 1 rectangle, and 1 is called a unit. The numbers, such as 5, that only have 1 by 5 and 5 by 1 rectangles, are called primes. Numbers that are not a unit or prime are called composite — they are called that because they are composed of primes being multiplied together, such as 12 = 2 x 2 x 3.@@The dimensions of each rectangle are made of values that evenly divide the number and multiply together to give the number. Making rectangles is a direct way to experience divisibility. Numbers such as 16 are called squares because one of their rectangles is a square – one rectangle for 16 is the 4 by 4 square.
P6	GAME — THE PADDOCK GAME@@Each player gets a piece of graph paper. For a player's turn, use two playing cards from 1 to 10 to determine the dimensions of a rectangle. If a player's paper has room, the rectangle may be placed anywhere its interior does not overlap with an existing rectangle. Once placed, its interior is lightly shaded and its area and dimensions are written on it. If there is no room, the turn is skipped. The player with the largest total wins. For a normal piece of graph paper, this can be a long game — reduce the time by using half the paper or limiting the number of turns.
P7	PUZZLE — DIVIDE UP THE BOX@@A rectangle, 4 by 4 or larger, with numbers in some of its squares,  is to be divided into smaller rectangles. Each number must end up  in a separate rectangle whose area is that number. @@Out of the sight of your child, create these puzzles by first filling in the big rectangle with smaller rectangles. Next, place the area in each rectangle. Lastly, give your child the big rectangle with only the numbers.@@To solve, look first at areas that are prime numbers. Also, sometimes an area is boxed in – in this puzzle the upper "4" must relate to the upper left 2 by 2 square. Next, the upper right corner must be used in a vertical 3 by 1 rectangle. Keep going!
P8	*SECTION* — FEEL THE POWER@@Prerequisite: Comfort multiplying single-digit numbers@@— A DEFINITION AND A RULE —@@Just as 4 x 2 is a quick way to write 2 + 2 + 2 + 2, so 2^4 is a quick way to write 2 x 2 x 2 x 2. It's much easier to say and understand the phrase "two to the fourth," than to say "two times two times … " There are two special names associated with powers. The second power, 4^2 for example, can be said four squared, and the third power, 4^3 for example, can be said four cubed.@@When two powers of the same number are multiplied, a simple rule governs how to simplify the result - the powers add up. For example, if you do 4^2 x 4^3 = (4 x 4) x (4 x 4 x 4) = 4^5, we have two fours multiplied by three fours, so the result is five fours being multiplied. Note that this rule of adding exponents only works when it is the same number being taken to a power.
P9	— REUSE OLD ADDITION ACTIVITIES —@@Because powers add up when powers are being multiplied, any of our old games and puzzles involving addition can be used to practice multiplying numbers that are powers. Some examples of this are: Chapter 3 — Shape Sums and Sum Groups; Chapter 4 — Enclosed Sums, SumTriangles, and Fix It.@@The first two examples were used in Chapter 3 for Shape Sums. The bottom two examples are for Shape Products where we use multiplication combining the circles instead of addition.
P10	With practice, this becomes routine and just as easy as the original addition problems.@@If your child is enjoying these problems and wants some extra challenge, start involving more than one number being raised to a power. For example, if you multiply (4^2 x 3^3) x (4^5 x 3^2) you can apply our rule separately to the powers of 4 and the powers of 3 and get the result 4^7 x 3^5.
P11	— PRACTICE PRIME FACTORIZATIONS —@@An excellent thing to practice when you are traveling and have time on your hands is to recite the prime factorizations for the numbers in order. This also provides practice with talking about powers. Knowing prime factorizations with ease will be helpful in many things to come, such as working with fractions. Have fun with this and don't push your child beyond their comfort level.@@It goes like this: 1 is a unit, 2 is a prime, 3 is a prime, 4 is 2 squared, 5 is a prime, 6 is 2 x 3, 7 is a prime, 8 is 2 cubed, 9 is 3 squared, 10 is 2 x 5, 11 is a prime, 12 is 2 squared x 3, 13 is a prime, 14 is 2 x 7, 15 is 3 x 5, and 16 is 2 to the fourth. If your child stumbles, help them figure it out rather than simply reminding them of the answer.
P12	*SECTION* — FACTORING WITH PRIMES@@Prerequisite: Comfort doing single-digit multiplication@@INVESTIGATION — FACTOR TREES@@Factor trees are an extension of Shape Products from the previous Feel the Power page. The goal in creating a factor tree is to reduce a number to its prime factors. Many things can be learned about a number in the process of constructing a factor tree.@@Start with a number, say 54. This can be broken down several ways. One way is  9 x 6, another is 18 x 3, and yet another is 3 x 3 x 6. Each of these produces a different start to a factor tree.
P13	Each of these trees ultimately produces the same primes on its leaves. In each case we end up with 2 x 3 x 3 x 3, but look at the different ways of getting there!@@After doing some examples like these, your child may naturally start asking some questions.@@Why do some trees have more levels than others? Why are some trees broader than others? Why do the leaves always stop at primes? Why do the leaves always have the same list of primes, perhaps with rearrangement?@@This last question is a really big question. It is so big it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. It says that each number has exactly one way of being expressed as a product of primes!
P14	You may ask: Why is that so important? It says that primes are the multiplicative building blocks of numbers, and once you have found one way to build a number, that is the only way. If you know that 54 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 3, then there is no way, using whole numbers, to write 54 = 5 x ___ . The uniqueness of prime factorizations is at the heart of a lot of beautiful number theory.@@PUZZLE — PRODUCT PYRAMID@@These puzzles are the multiplicative version of the Addition Pyramids seen in Chapter 4. You are supplied with a target number and a pyramid of numbers. The challenge is to find a path of connected numbers down the pyramid so the product of the selected numbers is the target.
P15	The target is 36 in this pyramid and the red lines indicate the path that works. Your child may notice that these puzzles are much easier if they start by doing the prime factorization of the target. Because 36 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3, they know they must pick up those prime factors along the path and this helps guide the search. Having the adult know about prime factorizations also makes it much easier to create these puzzles.
P16	*SECTION* — ADDING AND SUBTRACTING@@Prerequisite: Having a sense of 2-digit place value and how that relates to addition and subtraction.@@GAME — 5-CARD DRAW TO A TARGET@@Choose a target number, say 100. Each player picks up five random cards from 0 to 9. Two 2-digit numbers are made out of these numbers, the fifth card is unused. The two numbers are added and the player closest to the target wins a point for that round. The highest number of points after a fixed number of rounds wins.@@One option is to use three-digit numbers, a target number of 1000, and each player receives seven cards. Another option is to use subtraction with a smaller target number.
P17	GAME — 100 LAUGHS@@Use a deck of cards with Q's (as 0's), A's (as 1's), and 2-9's. Set the  target number at 100. Four random cards are chosen and used to make a pair of 2-digit numbers, a shared resource. @@Each player is dealt 14 random cards face up. Players alternate turns. During a turn, a player uses two cards to replace two of the four cards, and the resulting pair of numbers must add up to the target. A player passes if that is not possible. The first player to run out of cards wins. If both players become stuck, the player with fewer cards wins.@@Some options are to change the target number and to give players fewer or more than 14 cards. Another option is to use subtraction together with a smaller target number.
P18	PUZZLE — LETTER SUBSTITUTION@@Once your child becomes comfortable with the Missing Number puzzles from a few pages earlier in this chapter, they can start these puzzles. In these, one or more of the digits are replaced by letters. The three rules for letters are: @@    • A given letter is always the same digit@    • The leftmost digit of a number is never 0@    • Different letters must be different digits@@Create these puzzles by taking an addition or subtraction problem and replacing one or more of the digits, as in the following examples:
P19	The puzzles can also be created to make interesting problem-solving challenges for your child. Note that the values of the letters do not carry over from puzzle to puzzle.
