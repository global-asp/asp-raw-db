P1	One year ago I was just a normal girl until they came…..@@You're probably wondering who I am. I'm Lola Gane Smith  and I was the most popular girl in my  school until the day they came. I was swimming and Mom called  me . Dad was cooking some meat on the grill until we heard the buzz. It was a loud buzz and it followed with a crash!     @@That was the last time I saw them…..Mom and Dad. Soon after the loud noise I saw the scariest thing I could ever imagine.
P2	I could feel my bathing suit getting more wet with my sweat. I have never been more scared.  @@@They were so big and so green. 'BLEEP BLOP BLEEP PLOP'  said the smallest one 'BLOOP BLOOP BLEEP' said the biggest one. Were they going to kill me ? Were  they going to eat me up whole? All these questions drove me all around the bend.
P3	2.Meet the freeks@@ They had long and skinny legs with a big head. Their bodies were so skinny you could mistake them for a bunch of green toothpicks piercing a basketball.@@'WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY PARENTS YOU FREEKS'! I exclaimed 'BLOOP BLOOP PLOP POOB' said the medium one 'h-hi  h--h--hum-an' said the smallest one 'DON'T HI ME YOUR U.F.O LANDED ON MY PARENTS!'I shouted. 'Sorry humans, us BOOPLAPS can't see that well' said the biggest one.
P4	3.WHY MY!?@As soon as I could  get my voice back a screamed 'MUM DAD!'. I sat on the cold and rocky sand crying with three aliens looking at me. 'Please please let us hide with you' said the smallest 'Please we need not for other humans to see us'. I looked at them in absolute anger and at this point all I wanted to do was kill them! 'Please 'they said all together. I knew I needed someone to look after me at only 12 after all . 'OK' I said 'YAY' they all screamed 'But we nee
P5	Rule one no Goebbels language ,two no leaving the house,three please don't embarrass me !' 'We shape shift,'' said the medium one. ``We only need your parents' hair. I looked at them ,I was not about to let them take any hair from my parents. ' NO'. I shouted 'not my parentes hair'. We will do it anyway. We need to help you.
P6	4.My new family@@They took my parents' hair and just ate it .The biggest one turned into my dad and the medium one turned into my mom .It was so good to see them. It was like they were right next to me but inside I knew they weren't . The smallest one did not transform; he said he was going to be the dog. As soon as we got home we shaved my dog and put him into the basement . Now that my family was back to normal my life was not.
P7	At school I couldn't speak to anyone my life was now different and I was the only one who could feel it.
