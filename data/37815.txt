P1	Hi guys my name is Shaiyah, and I'm here being made perfectly for my mommy and daddy. I'm an Angel right now flying high in the sky with my some of my bestest friends, and soon we'll all be with our mommies and daddies.
P2	Today is the big day! I'm going to be with mommy eventhough I'll be smaller than a apple seed I'm so super excited.
P3	Mommy looks really sad and im still an angel flying in the clouds. I'm not ready for mommy yet. I want to make sure im perfect for my mommy and daddy.
