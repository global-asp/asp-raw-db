P1	Bianca,a five years old girl stood by the window side watching the life outside, Wondering how the universe came to be.@She wondered who created the earth,she thought of the wind,the sun,the trees and then herself.
P2	She had asked her parent about how the earth came to be and who created everything in it,but when her parent told her it was a supernatural being called God,she asked them who created God and if God has a parent like she does.
P3	To Bianca's disappointment,her parent couldn't provide an answer and they told her that the question she asked is mysterious and complicated because nobody knows how the supernatural being came to exist.
P4	But little bianca could not give up on her quest and her curiosity continue to grow day by day. When Bianca was seven, Bianca's dad got her a little pocket bible and told her that she could find all the answers she needed in the bible.
P5	Bianca's curiosity got the best out of her as she continue to read and study the Bible hoping to find the history of the supernatural being and how he came to exist.@But it was never mentioned that this supernatural being has a parent!
P6	When Bianca's parent noticed that she still habor the curiosity,they warned her and told her she could go insane trying to figure out who the sacred being is.@Afraid of losing her mind,she told herself to stop thinking about it.
P7	Her parent continued to warn her that if she doesn't say goodbye to her little curious self,she might end up facing a lot of trouble in the future because they are some things that just happen and are unexplainable.
P8	Bianca gave up on her quest to find how the supernatural being came to exist,but never stopped asking her teachers and parent some academics question as she believes the lesson taught to her were man -made and should have history!
