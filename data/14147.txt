page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived a very beutiful girl by the name philipa she was only six years of age. She went to school at jerusalem toto academy. She loved her classmates so much. They also loved to play with her. Philipa stayed with her grandmother. Her grand mother loved her so muchand she loved her too.
P2	The stories about the robots too she was told by the grandmother.
P3	She took ttheir goats too for grazing. She had a friend called peter who used to escort her for grazing they told themselves stories whenever they were in the field grazing.
P4	After grazing her grandmother could make for them food mainly goat milk and roasted maize. After that they could go to a silent place with peter and read what they were taught at school.
P5	After reading, their grand mother could story tell them before they left for bed she told them the stories about robots, animals, birds and their child hood stories how they used to play with non breathing human beings known as dolls.
P6	Philipa was interested in bird stories so wherever she went she watched birds keenly how they flew in the air and how they landed on land.
P7	One day her grandmother told her that tortoise can run faster and become number when it is competing with an eagle. Philipa didnt believe that. So one she heard that there was to be a competition between tortoise and an eagle she went to the field to watch.
P8	Before they started an eagle told the tortoise that it could not win the race that it was a waste of time competing with it. The tortoise insisted that it was going to win. The race started and an the eagle started at avery bhigh speed leaving the tortoise behind. Philipa knew that her grandmother lied to her. Tortoise cant win!she thought.
P9	Tortoise thought faster and it tried as hard as it to could to jump at the back of an eagle.
P10	The tortoise jumped over and within the shortest time possible,  it was at the back of the eagle. Eagle seeing that he couldnt see the tortoise any more, it thought that it had elready won. It thought that it was far much from eagle and that however much the tortoise could try to reach him,  it could not make it. It became over confident for he knew that he had already won. Philipa watched the drama and she could stand to stop laughing.
P11	The tortoise could also stop smiling at the back of the eagle for he knew the trick he had used inorder to win the race. When they about o reach the landing point,  the tortoise jumped over the eagle so fast that he became the winner.
P12	The day after Philipa had watched the race she was so much happy about and she asked the teacher if he could make that lesson to be astory telling session, and the teacher was so much impressed by her and allowed her to give them their story. The teacher postponed the PE lesson to give philipa chance to tell her story.
P13	Philipa told her classmates the story and they all happy to hear the story about the eagle and the tortoise. Some came to her after the lesson asking her how she came to the story. And she told them that it was her grandmothe"s inspiration to her."
