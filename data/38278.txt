desc:	Subiso gets stuck in a tree because of her curiosity

page_text:

P1	Subiso was a good girl that always helped adults more than playing with others in the village of Zambezi.
P2	Subiso was one time bullied by her brothers and she cried.
P3	Subiso was curious of how place looks when she is up so she climbed a near by tree.
P4	When she reached the top she got scared and wanted to get down so she was screaming as loud as she could and her parents came to get her down but she was hesitating
P5	Her friend Mabito saw her on the tree and she was trying to convince her to get down from the tree
P6	Maputo surprisingly managed to get Sabiso down from from the tree and she was happy about that and then they walked happily and talked on their way home
P7	Everyone was excited in joy that they had a party for her and invited their other family members. The End.
