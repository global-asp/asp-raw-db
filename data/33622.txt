page_text:

P1	There is a Boda boda man with a crooked nose. Everyone knows him.@@"Your motorbike has been missing in action around our school.@In the morning, at lunch time and four o'clock, what is the problem?
P2	The boda man with a crooked nose, why don't you carry boys?@You have a problem carrying our brothers in the morning and after school.@When they stop you, you pretend to be busy, rushing to carry those girls.@What is good with girls' money, or you carry them for free?
P3	Boda man with a crooked nose, where did your wife go?@The class six girl in this school, the class seven girl in the other school.@The ones you promised to marry, two at once and made both pregnant at a go.@Both are now out of school, both have a child without a father, wasted their time.
P4	Boda man with a crooked nose, are you sure you don't have AIDS?@You could be a hero now, chasing primary school children,@Who have no knowledge and strength, who need money and rides.@Who have no protection and courage to tell you NO.
P5	Boda man with a crooked nose, who will teach your thousand children,@Who will nurse you when you are old and helpless,@Who will repair your bike and feed your children@If all girls are pregnant, out of school, jobless and poor?
P6	Boda man with a crooked nose, change your ways. The world needs educated girls.
