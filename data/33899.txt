page_text:

P1	Our ancestors drank water from ponds with their bare hands. It always required thinking and making to improve the life of human beings.
P2	After long times of ups and downs human beings invented tap water and enjoyed the water that came to their homes and workplaces.
P3	Cleaning floors was also a bit tiresome. Every morning people bent down to clean their floors.
P4	A vacuum cleaner cleans better and faster.
P5	Moving from a place to another took long times. People spent outside for hours, days, weeks and sometimes months. They walked for long long times.
P6	Then, someone invented a bike. A bike could help people move a bit faster.
P7	Imagine how human beings improved travel. An airplane is the fastest mode of transport.
P8	Now imagine other ways people improved their lives by thinking and making?
