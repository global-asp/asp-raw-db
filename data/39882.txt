P3	Long time ago in a village called Xabane there was a forest where there were giant people called Zim-Zim and people were fearful of them. People were not suppose to go alone in the forest because they were scared of Zim-Zim.
P4	There was a girl called Noma was living with her mother Nombulelo. Nombulelo told Noma to go with her friends and fetch firewood.@Nombulelo: "Noma I am going to town and you have to go with your friends to the forest, okay?"@Noma: "Okay ma"
P5	Noma met with her friends near the forest.@Zintle: "Guys let's go now before it gets late I am afraid of Zim-Zim"@Lunje: " Yes let's go, Noma what are you thinking?"@Noma was far away with thoughts on her head.@Noma:" you guys can go"

P7	Later Noma went to the forest alone and made lot of sound trying to see if Zim-Zim can hear her, unfortunately they did and were very furious because they hate noise and Noma started to be very scared and she was caught by Zim-Zim.
P8	Noma was crying asking for help and Zim-Zim did not care at all they took her to their home and she was chained and told to not ever run or else she will be eaten for supper and she nodded. Zim-Zim argued about they should kill her.
P9	Other said " no we should wait till the next day,for sure her parents are looking for her" they end up agreeing on waiting for the next day. And Noma was praying for saviour but no one can hear her even if she cries loud for help.
P10	On the other side young boys were looking for her but they didn't find her they went back home with sad news and Noma's mother was very hurt and praying that her daughter to come back home.
P11	On the next day Noma was unchained and the Zim-Zim were happy preparing her for supper and then Noma tried to run and fortunately she made it and she met young boys Lazo and Jabu who helped her to go back home.
P12	Noma was taken to her mother and her mother was very happy and Noma apologized to her mother for not listening to her and she promised to never do that again.@Villagers ask her so many questions after that she was happy with her mother.
