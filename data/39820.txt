page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there lived a group of frogs in a beautiful pond. They all were happy to live together. They played all along and helped each other with everything.
P2	However, they were all not the same!@One frog was the thinnest of all. He could leap to the highest of the stones.@Another was the fastest of all. He could catch his flies before anything else could even see them.
P3	And then there was Max! He was the biggest among all!@Everyday, Max had more than a dozen flies and insects for his meal. Other frogs were always scared of him because of his size! @But Max love the attention!
P4	He felt proud of his size and ofen made fun of the smaller frogs.@Oh! HA HA! @You can leap onto the highest stone? So that means you can run faster from the bigger animals that will attack you?@Good for you!
P5	I don't need that skill! Nobody is big as I am!@Do you really think that nobody is as big as Max?@How do we know? We have never seen a bigger one!
P6	Since the pond was deep inside the forest, not many animals visited to drink from it!@An dso everybody thought that Max indeed was largest on the planet!@Max was happy to think that too.@How lucky I am to be the big one!
P7	Max had four little children. They always played near the pond with the other frogs. @Hey! Masihambeni siyodlala ngakula mthi! There are many big stones over there! @Oh! I would rather not! Mamma has asked me to play on this side.
P8	Oh! Come on! My daddy is the largest of all the creatures! @Ungoyiki!@We will call out to him if we are troubled.@Eh...... Andazi. @Mamma will be mad at me.@Don't you worry. If she says anything to you, we will ask my dad to talk to her.
P9	She will not scold you then.@Ummm.... Okay. @Masihambeni.@Without wasting another minute, all the kids hopes and jumped to the other side of the pond, beyond the big tree. There were surprised to see another small pond under the great tree.
P10	Oh! Look at that! There is another pond here! I thought there was only one pond on this planet!@Oh! We must not think thank. There is a lot that our eyes don't see! This is a huge plenet!@Are you going to keep talking now? Masidlaleni!
P11	They leaped onto highest stone and one after another, jumped into the pond with a loud splash!@Suddenly, the ground started to shake. @Oh! No! What is happening here? Why is the ground shaking?@Oh! We never should have left out pond.
P12	We are going to die!!@Oh! What is that!@The chicken were terrified as they saw a weird looking creature walk towards the pond. It was as tall as the highest stone! @It's belly wiggled with ever step it took. And it made a loud noise!
P13	Children hurriedly leapt on the stones to go back home! But in their haste, the little red frog slipped and fell in to the pond! @Oh! No! Yima!@Phuma! Izakutya!@What is all the commotion about? Ningobani? I have never seen you before!
P14	Oh! Please big creature! Please ungandityi!@What! Eat you?@HA HA HA! Why on earth would I want to eat you? I am here only to drink water!@Oh! That means you will not attack us?@Oh! No! I don't eat frogs!
P15	Then what do you eat? How did you get so big? My daddy eats so many insects in a day! And yet is not even half as big as you are!@Your daddy? You mean a frog?@HA HA! He can never be as big as I am. I was born in this size.
P16	Every animal has its own size!@You mean there are another animals that are bigger then you?@Of course!@Children were surprised to hear about other animals that were bigger than the Ox himself! They sat there for hours listening to the
P17	stories of other animals.@Soon, the night fell and they had to waive goodbye to their new friend.@Let's go home quickly! I have so much to tell daddy!
P18	Yes! Come!@All the children went straight to Max and narrated the entire tale. The stories were so interesting that all the frogs gathered to hear them.@HA HA HA!@Oh my innocent little ones!@Did you just say that this some Mr Ox was bigger
P19	than me?@Not just that Daddy! He said that there are animals which are even bigger than him! And they come to that pond over there to drink water.@Ewe! Ewe! And he also said that you can never be as big as he is!@That's crazy!
P20	How can anybody be as big as I am!@He ticked you. He must have bloated himself up to prove his lies.@Ulixoki!@This can be true Max!@I always talk to the birds that came to drink water here. I have heard stories about other animals from them
P21	It will be our biggest mistake to think that we are the greatest!@It is your biggest mistake, not mine!@I am the biggest creature on this planet!@That is a fact!@Why not we wait until the morning and find out for ourselves?
P22	The kids said that these huge animals come there to drink water. We will go there in the morning and find out the truth.@The crowd agreed. But Max was furious. He had to prove that he was the biggest if all. Or else, he thought, no one will
P23	ever respect him again.@No! We will decide this right now! Nobody will fool my kids!@That Mr Ox thought that, he could get away with his lies!@How dare he say that I can never be as big as he is!
P24	Max stretched his back and stood straight. He then bloated his stomach. His size grew bigger.@Tell me was he as big as this?@No! Bigger, daddy!@Max bloated his stomach a bit more....@Was he as big as this?@No! Bigger!
P25	Max! You don't have to do this! Every animal has a different skill!@I am sure with his big size, Mr Ox can never jump the way we do!@Yes, Max. You have to stop. You will hurt yourself.@But Max was not ready to give up.
P26	He could not hear his friends' advice, he could only hear, 'as big as an Ox!' and that's what he wanted to become!@Ignoring everyone, he bloated his stomach a bit more.@Was he as big as this?@No, Daddy. Bigger!
P27	Now Max's back arched and he bloated a bit more!@Was he as big as this?@Bigger!@Max's face had turned blue and he bend a bit more!@His eyes were popping out!@Was...he...as...big...as...this?@Max, stop! You are hurting yourself!
P28	Tell me. Was he as big as this?@No, Daddy. Bigger!@The frog was right. Max was hurting! His back was stretched, eyes were popping out and his stomach hurt with the bloating. But he didn't give up. He had to prove that he was indeed the
P29	biggest of all! He took a deep breath and bloated a bit more!@Was he as big as.......@No! DADDY!@NO! DADDY!@NO! DADDY!@NO! DADDY!@But was too late. Max's stomach had popped!
P30	He had bloated himself beyond his body's ability.
P31	His kids cried and cried.@Everybody was sad.
P32	Max, my friend! @If only you had listened to us!@We all are big in our own way!@Never try to become someone else!
