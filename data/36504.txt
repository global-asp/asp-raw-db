page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl. They used to ride the school bus together and do homework while drinking EarlGrey tea and munching on fresh cookies.
P2	They would watch hamsters and play board games. But the girl would always cheat at the board games and the boy would let her win. One day the boy married the girl and they played board games happily ever after.
