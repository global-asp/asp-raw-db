page_text:

P1	The Moon and the Sun were once together, they loved each other and lived happily in the sky. Everything was complete.
P2	They both loved each other like no other and they kept the Earth at balance.
P3	The Sun kept the Earth warm while the Moon kept it stable during its rotations.
P4	Until one fateful day when everything changed.
P5	There was a big explosion in the sky, a big bang. The Moon and the Sun were separated from each other. Separated in both distance and time.
P6	They could not see each other anymore. They were both devastated and felt incomplete.
P7	They were both sad. They longed for each other's love. Their love was so strong that it transcended through time and space.
P8	But all was not lost as something was about to happen, something that will change everything. Something that will change their fate.
P9	Suddenly there was a force of extraction that caused them to move closer to each other every once in a while. Eventually sun the moon would be together during a process called Solar Eclipse.
P10	Finally, they were together and they were very happy. It was not like before but that did not matter. What mattered was the the time and space they had.
P11	During this process they did not have enough time. They made every second count. Their burning love was so strong and bright that people had to wear special glasses just to look at them in the sky. The whole world looked at them with admiration.
P12	The Moon and Sun felt each other's love as time caused them to drift away from each other into the deep void space. Their love still burning through time and space. While apart, they both longed, longing for another Eclipse of Love.
P13	The End.
