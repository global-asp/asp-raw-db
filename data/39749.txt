P2	One day Raven told Hyena that he had seen a beehive somewhere. They agreed to go harvest the honey. As they came close, Hyena told Raven to climb the tree. Raven went up and threw lumps honey down as Hyena collected it in to basin.
P3	The raven had no idea that Hyena had eaten all the honey. When he came down, he found nothing. Hyena's stomach grew very big. He told Raven to sew his back so that the sweetness of the honey will not come out of his stomach.
P4	Days passed without Hyena going to the toilet, Causing  him discomfort. He struggled to sit or sleep. He went to look for Raven who had already found a new home. @On his way he met a goat who told him to keep on searching for the Raven.
P5	The Hyena went and met the hare. The Hare told him where to find the Raven.
P6	Finally, the Hyena found the Raven seated down. Hyena told him that since he sewed his back, he had not been able to to relieve himself and hence he was very uncomfortable. He pleaded with Raven to open his back.
P7	Raven agreed and with his beak he opened Hyena's back. Immediately, feaces came out and buried the Raven. Hyena left him there struggling. Since that day the raven turned Black.
