page_text:

P1	It was six o clock on a Saturday morning when I awoke.It was a clear,crisp morning and the air was fresh. It was pleasantly warm and so I decided to go for a walk through the trees. I pulled on my takkies and the red jacket and I was off.
P2	I heard all the sweet sounds all around me and I breathed it all in. I remembered reading somewhere that your diet is not only what you eat but everything you see,smell,touch,hear and taste. I find it very true. I think this diet is ideal.
P3	As I went through this peaceful abode of happiness and truth I remembered a lesson I learnt on a day during the holiday. It was so important that I realised myself on that day. I was asked a good question.
P4	The question was: If you were to spend the rest of your life with someone exactly like you would you be happy ? My answer was a long painful, sad, heartbreaking :"No", and there followed a lot of big salty tears rolling down my cheeks.
P5	After the long talk that followed I realised that I wasn't happy or content with myself and that is why I was so miserable. But I knew that any day is a good day to change. And that's what I did.
P6	This change is being loving towards everybody and wearing a smile. It is being kind and doing your duties. It is spending time with your family and laughing. It is having a positive attitude and energy. It is in being willing to help.
P7	So if your answer to that question was a long, painful, sad and heartbreaking No, then free yourself from the drama of the past, the pain, the mistakes and put it in the past. You aren't responsible for others actions only your reactions.
P8	Renew yourself and change your attitude. Heal and grow. Improve and work smart. Smile and love yourself. Respect your boundaries. Be disciplined. And this book is your sign to do just that.
