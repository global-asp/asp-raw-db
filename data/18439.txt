P1	A long time ago,  there was a greedy Hyena.
P2	There was also Tortoise. Hyena and Tortoise were friends.
P3	Hyena told Tortoise,  "Let us search for honey."
P4	Hyena ran fast. Tortoise followed slowly. He was afraid.
P5	They crossed a river. They got wet.
P6	Then they saw beehives. Hyena ran to the hives.
P7	Hyena told Tortoise,  "Climb up and get the beehive."
P8	Tortoise climbed slowly. Hyena was angry. He shouted at Tortoise.
P9	Tortoise touched the beehive. Bees swarmed in the air.
P10	Tortoise fell. The beehive fell on him. Hyena licked the honey.
P11	The bees stung Hyena. He ran. The bees followed him.
P12	Hyena ran into the river. The bees still followed him.
P13	The beehive and the honey dried on Tortoise's back.
