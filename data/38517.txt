page_text:

P1	Bonga was a young boy from a small village in Willowvale. He lived with his father and mother who were not employed. The only money they had was enough to buy food.
P2	One day he asked his parents to buy him a bicycle. He told them that his friend Sipho had a bicycle and did not allow him to ride. His parents told him that they have no money for the bicycle.
P3	Bonga was upset, he ran out of the house crying. He ran to the river, he sat down and cried. He heard a sweet small voice calling him.
P4	He looked up and saw a strange young girl smiling at him. The girl had wings and she was flying above Bonga. She also had magic wand in her hand.@"Why are you crying Bonga?", asked the girl waving her wand over Bonga.
P5	"How do you know my name?", Bonga responded. "I know everything. I know that you are crying for a bicycle.", the girl said as she was sitting down next to Bonga.
P6	The girl told Bonga that her name is Candy and with her magic wand, she can make him forget about the bicycle. She waved her wand in the air and suddenly there was a box full of toys, sweets and other nice things.
P7	"This box is yours.", said Candy. They both played the toys and ate all the nice things together. Bonga forgot about the bicycle, he played his toys. He had a new friend, Candy.
