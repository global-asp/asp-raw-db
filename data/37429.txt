page_text:

P1	Before I got sick, I was just me.@Just another happy boy you see.@Then suddenly I was in the hospital a lot,@I had a port put in and I got shot after shot.
P2	On some days I felt fine, but some days I was a whale so blue.@On many different days, I had different feelings too.@You'd be surprised how many ways I changed my mood on many different days.
P3	On good blood count days how good it feels@to be a horse and kick my heels!@On other days I'm the elephant in the room.@And I see my family trying to fight the gloom.
P4	In those days, of course, I feel sort of down@When my medicine arrives I stop monkeying around.@Then comes an IT day and weeee!@Everyone's fussing over me.
P5	Here comes a no energy day.@I move like a sloth and stay on my iPad today.@Then all of a sudden I'm a circus seal!@I ride on my IV pole made of cold, smooth steel.
P6	Dizzy Days. My tummy feels queasy.@Like a turtle riding on waves in the sea.@On dog days, I miss my home.@I drag my tail. I want to be alone.
P7	But when my days are bright and pink@I feel like a flamingo on a skating rink.@Then all of a sudden I'm a wolf with a scowl.@I feel so mad I can't help but growl.
P8	Then, I'm a chameleon all mixed up on steroid days.@My emotions shift in so many different ways.
P9	Now, my treatment is done, no more chemo!@I'm feeling like a brave and strong dino.@And in the end, it all turns out all right, you see.@As I go back to being... ME.
