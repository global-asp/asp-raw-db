page_text:

P1	Once there was a shy girl named Anna. She was the only shy girl in her class. She loved writing and reading. But she's terrified of orals. Because she does not like talking infront of the whole class.
P2	She avoided the orals. Then on break time Anna sits alone. Eating her lunch. Then there came new children to the class. The class was laughing at them but Anna called them to sit with her. They became close friends.
P3	Anna told them not to worry what anyone says about them. Then suddenly the teacher said, class so tomorrow will be oral. You should be prepared. Anna was shocked she was so scared. She didn't know what to do. But she became sick after day.
P4	She gave a letter to her teacher to say why she was absent. Then the teacher said, it's okay so now you can go stand infront of the class and do your oral. Anna could not believe her ears. She was so scared.
P5	But she gave it her all. She talked about soccer cause she loved playing it. And gave everyone a chance to tackle her. She was happy to see the children enjoying themselves. So she carried on.
P6	She gave them challenges between each other and the teacher was impressed. Everyone was having a great time. She realised that she was doing great. And she was! After she was done. Everyone clapped their hands for her.
P7	She was not shy anymore. And she also teaches other children about shyness. She told them stories about when she was shy. The children became impressed with her words. Everyone loved her. Anna became popular in the school.
