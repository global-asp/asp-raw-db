P2	They went out of the estate to compete riding Zandu's bicycle.Zandu went first and he did some twists and turns and came back with just a pain on his wrist. The crowd cheered for he showed his prowess and they were impressed.
P3	Next was Alpha. He jumped on the bicycle and took off. Suddenly the bicycle speeded up to the hill and there was a stack of hay by the road the bicycle swerved towards it.
P4	Screeching downhill and into the thorny bush. His body was prickled and his clothes torn off.His head was hit on the road it was swirling in pain. The bicycle was broken into pieces.
P5	"Am I going to die today?" "Why did I show off?" Alpha asked himself. He asked God to forgive him for his pride and to save him too. Finally he was taken to hospital and the bicycle for repair.
P6	Later Alpha's uncle bought a new bicycle for him and taught him how to ride it and he became a great bicycle rider in his county.
