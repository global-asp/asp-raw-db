P2	One day, Amina found the most beautiful flower in the garden. She loved its scent so much that she didn't want to leave it.@@She plucked the flower and held it in her hands.
P3	As she was leaving the garden, she heard thunder.@@She knew it would rain soon. She decided to hurry home.
P4	She heard more thunder and was  afraid of lightning.@@She stopped and listened.
P5	It then started raining. @@Amina tried to run but by bad luck, she slipped and fell.
P6	Luckily, Amina's neighbours found her in the garden. They took her home and put a bandage where she was bleeding. @@Amina was grateful to the neighbours for their help.
P7	Amina forgot about the pain she was in. She wanted her flower. Children found the flower floating in the water and brought it to Amina.@@Amina was very happy to have the flower back.
