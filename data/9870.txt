P1	Once upon a time,  there lived a chief who had not yet got married. He lived in Ranker village. He was kind to everyone in his village. One day,  he decided to get married. But in his village,  there were four girls who prayed private that they would be chosen to become the wives of the chief. But the chief had an eye on a girl called Tina. Tina was beautiful and humble. She came in a very simple family in another village. The following day,  the chief found that very girl and asked her kindly to marry him. Tina was silent and the chief was chocked. Tina talked once that, ' I will not give you an answer now because I am going to ask my elder sister and she is also my friend,  she added. The chief was patient and he waited for an answer to come.
P2	The next day,  Tina went to the chief's home to tell him an answer. The chief was surprised to see Tina coming. When Tina reached at the door,  the chief opened the door. The chief was very happy and excited. He greeted her and Tina replied. Tina said my words are not much,  I only say that I need you to be my husband. The chief jumped and gave her a hug. The chief asked for an excuse,  Tina did. Then,  the chief entered a certain room and brought a golden bang for Tina. The chief said,  take this bang as a sign that you are mine. Then Tina left. When she went back home,  she packed her things and left. She went back to the chief's home. It was already dark.
P3	As soon as she reached,  the chief had already fallen a sleep. She knocked the door at once but the chief was no where to be seen. She knocked again. Then the chief opened the door.
