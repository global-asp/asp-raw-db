desc:	A short Zambian story explaining why the sky is so high.

page_text:

P1	Long ago in Chadima Village, the sky was like a roof over the earth. It was so low, that the people could reach up and touch it. Their Gods lived inside the sky.
P2	The sky was so low that the Gods could always hear the people's prayers, songs, and fights. When the people needed help, they would look up and speak to the Gods.
P3	But the Gods had no rest. The people made noise all day and all night. They wiped their dirty hands on the clouds, making the home of the Gods dirty.
P4	One day, after harvest time, all the women of Chadima came together and started pounding their corn in many, many mortars with long and heavy pounding sticks.
P5	As the sticks were raised and lowered, the women poked and punched the sky. The Gods were hit and pushed. The women worked all day and all night, hurting the Gods.
P6	The Gods had enough! They called a meeting fast and decided that the sky must be raised higher if they wanted to be safe from the pounding sticks of the women.
P7	Quickly, they raised the sky so high that the women of the earth could not hurt them. And that is why the sky is so high today. The End.
