desc:	A local chief summoned a famous blacksmith to his palace. The chief wanted the blacksmith to build a real man out of steel

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in a mountainous Musamba village there lived a famous blacksmith. The villagers called him Mungwala - the man of iron and steel.
P2	Mungwala was known by everyone in the village. Villagers went to his hut every morning to watch him work. He seemed to be able to make anything with his iron and steel.
P3	Sekwila,  the village chief,  heard about Mungwala's work. He sent his headmen to bring Mungwala to the palace.
P4	Mungwala was happy to hear that Sekwila wanted to see him. "I will be very happy to work for the chief," he said.
P5	So Mungwala went to the palace. "Mungwala,  I have heard  so much about your good work," said Sekwila. "I want you to do a very special task."
P6	"With your iron and steel,  I want you to build a man who can walk,  cry real tears and bleed real human blood." "Impossible!" thought Mungwala. But no one could say no to the chief in this village.
P7	Mungwala could not sleep that night. How was he going to do this impossible task? He was very scared and very worried.
P8	Suddenly,  Mungwala remembered a wise old man Kalaiti. Perhaps he could help. But where was Kalaiti? He had disappeared from the village. People said that it was because he had displeased the chief.
P9	The next morning Mungwala did not go to work. He went up the mountains to think. While walking there,  he saw a man sitting under a  mupundu tree.
P10	It was old Kalaiti! "I am so pleased to see you," said Mungwala. "I have a big problem." He told Kalaiti the whole story. Kalaiti thought carefully,  and then he said.
P11	"Tell the chief that you will need a thousand 20 litres buckets full of tears and a thousand  large clay pots full of hair. With the water,  you will make blood. With the hair,  you will make a fire to strengthen the steel man." "Thank you,  thank you!" Mungwala said,  running back to the palace.
P12	Mungwala said,  "Sekwila,  to do what you ask,  I will need two things. A thousand 20 litres buckets full of tears; and a thousand large clay pots filled with hair from the heads of  all the villagers." Sekwila agreed. He asked his headmen to tell the villagers.
P13	Cries were heard from every corner of the village. Young and old people cried day and night to fill a thousand buckets with tears. Every villager's head was shaved off and thrown into the pots. But the tears and hair of all the villagers were not enough to fill the buckets and pots.
P14	Eventually Sekwila gave up and called Mungwala back to the palace. "Mungwala,  you are a wise man,  the wisest in the village," said Sekwila. "Will you do me the honour of being my chief headman?" Mungwala smiled.
P15	"Only if you let Kalaiti come back to the village," he replied. So Mungwala became chief headman. And he and Kalaiti were the advisors of Sekwila.
