P1	CHAPTER ONE @@The day was bright and the time was right, today me and my friend saved creatures and played with a dog we saved: two ladybugs 🐞🐞 @And a baby snail 🐌. We had to wear gloves to help pick them up.
P2	Harvey's skills: spying, finding animals, fast runner, good parkour,  and building from wood. @@Jacoby's skills: building from wood, finding creatures, parkour and@Fast runner
P3	This is the home we built to help, the animals and a cricket and little ants came in it is full of grass we built it out of wood.
P4	We used this as a tool we use it to clean spots, to get to the animals and creatures so we can save them. 1 time we had to save a spider, from a drain with the tool we opened the drain and saved the spider.
P5	This is covid,  also the reason we didn't pick up the creatures with our hands and why we used gloves and wood. The creatures could spread covid which would be bad for us.
P6	This is how a polluted area looks like, to the creatures around you all the small things you see are big things they see.
P7	CHAPTER TWO@@Today me and my friend found a new member called Elis she told us to make a page about stepping on creatures i said ok; because it'll make them not do it.
P8	TO BE CONTINUED!!!!!!!!!
