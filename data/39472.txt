page_text:

P1	Hully Hippo lived in the forest and went to school with all her forest friends. They had so much fun racing each other to school and back home. @@They knew each other and had grown up together in the forest.
P2	Their school was in the middle of the forest under a huge tree. They liked to sit together at break time and tell stories to each other. @@One sunny day, a new student came to their school. His name was Gary Giraffe, and his family had just moved to live in the forest. @@The other kids were amazed to see a Giraffe.
P3	"Look how tall and beautiful he is," they all said pointing at him. @@At break time they all stood around him to admire him. They invited him to the lake where they liked to swim after school.
P4	At the lake, Gary Giraffe started laughing at Hully Hippo's feet. "She has such big and ugly feet. She cannot wear shoes. She steps onto the dirty ground all the time." The other Kids started laughing too. @@Hully Hippo started crying and went to sit by herself. Her friend Manny Mongoose followed her and they sat together.
P5	There was a great wind and Gary Giraffe's school bag was blown and tossed into the lake. The wind took the bag far and he could not reach it, no one could swim that far. Hully Hippo quickly jumped into water and swam after the bag.
P6	Everyone was amazed at how fast she could swim. She brought the bag back to the shore and everyone was happy. Gary Giraffe apologized to Hully Hippo and Ellen Elephant told her that she had beautiful and powerful feet and was a very good swimmer.
P7	Manny Mongoose stood on a log, and shouted, "We are all different, we are all beautiful and we are all helpful". Everyone was happy and they all played together.
