page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a Royal Couple who ruled over their people with love. Queen Sarah and King Ade had everything they wanted except a child. Night and day, Queen Sarah would cry because of her barrenness.
P2	One day, Queen Sarah's sister suggested to the King that a change of scenery would be good for the Queen. King Ade agreed with Elizabeth's reasoning so he begged  Queen Sarah to go for a vacation in Odufe--her father's hometown.
P3	Queen Sarah reluctantly went to Odufe where she spent time with her elderly parents. her parents were very happy to see her and they tried to make her forget about her childlessness.

One day, Queen Sarah went to the stream to fetch water where she met a very beautiful girl playing with animals and having fun just by the river.
P4	She wished the little girl was hers but she didn't allow the tears fall from her eyes.

"Hello little girl" Queen Sarah said
"Good morning ma" the girl replied respectfully.

Queen Sarah was impressed by the girl's good manners.

"What is your name and who are your parents?" Queen Sarah asked.
"My name is Asa and my parents are dead".
P5	Queen Sarah felt very sad for Asa.
"Who takes care of you?"
"My aunt but she doesn't care about me. She is very wicked!"

There and then, Queen Sarah decided that she was going to adopt Asa whether the aunt would like it or not. The little angel needed love and was too beautiful to be left on her own.
P6	Asa's aunt was very happy to get rid of her. She had been thinking of selling the little girl to the human merchants. She was barely thirty and didn't want to be tied down. She was happy that the girl had found  someone who wanted her. Asa was a good girl but her aunt just wasn't ready for the stress!
P7	Queen Sarah's parents fell in love with Asa. She was so beautiful and polite. They were happy that their daughter now had a child of her own. 

Queen Sarah took Asa back to her kingdom where the Queen, King, Lady Elizabeth accepted her and took good care of her.

Princess Asa was never sad again and the Queen never cried ever again!
