desc:	This story explores the many roles a mother plays

page_text:

P1	Mother has a shop. @@She looks after her shop, her customers, her suppliers, and her family.@@She says she really misses our father when he travels!
P2	Her phone rings almost non-stop.@@Customers call to ask prices, and to place their orders.@@They call to trace their orders, and to complain about their orders.
P3	We often go to her shop in the afternoons. @@We tell her about school.@@But our conversations are always interrupted by customers eager for her attention.
P4	We have fun with children who come to the shop with their parents.@@Sometimes, mother has to serve as referee as well as help customers. @@I think that she has super powers!
P5	When we become too noisy, mother says, "Now sit quietly and watch TV."@@She always adds, "But only for 30 minutes, while we take a break!"
P6	If we don't have schoolwork, sometimes mother asks me or my older sister to help her. @@I am not always ready to help.@@But I do it because I know she works so hard.
P7	As we walk home from the shop with the sun setting, we talk about our day.@@We have to hurry to keep up with her, but we love walking and talking with mother.
P8	She makes sure that we do homework, and have time to play.@@She makes sure that we eat vegetables and fruits, and drink water.@@When we are sick, she cares for us.
P9	At night, mother continues to work at home. @@There is always work from the shop.@@Sometimes she falls asleep at the table!
P10	Father makes sure that mother has time to relax, and he helps around the house. @@"You're a Super Mummy!" he says. @@"And you're my Super Super!" smiles mother.
