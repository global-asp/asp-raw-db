page_text:

P1	One day,  a goat went out in the bush,  and wandered around happily. But then she got lost!
P2	Suddenly,  she met a wolf! The wolf came up to her,  and said,  "I am very hungry."
P3	The goat said,  "Mr Wolf,  I know you want to eat me. But I would like to die happy!"
P4	The wolf asked the goat,  "What do you mean? Die happy? How?"
P5	The goat answered,  "If I have to die,  I would like to die dancing!"
P6	Then the wolf took his guitar. He sat down and started playing it.
P7	The goat started dancing,  though she was still a little bit worried.
P8	There were dogs nearby. They came to see what was happening.
P9	The wolf was afraid of dogs. So,  he turned and ran away!
P10	The goat kept on dancing,  because now she was free from the wolf!
