page_text:

P1	My little brother sleeps late. @@I wake early,  because I am great!
P2	I am the one who lets in the sun.
P3	"You're my morning star," says Ma.
P4	I wash myself every day,  I don't need any help.
P5	I don't mind cold water, or the blue soap that washes clothes.
P6	Ma reminds,  "Don't forget your teeth." @@I reply,  "Never,  not me!"
P7	After washing,  I greet Grandpa and Auntie. @@I wish them a good day.
P8	Then I dress myself.  @@"I'm big now, Ma," I say.
P9	I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.
P10	I make sure my brother knows all the school news.
P11	In class I do my best in every way.
P12	I do all these good things every day. @@But the thing I like most,  is to play and play!
