P1	                                                CHAPTER 3!                      ADA LEARNS A BIG LESSON Ada kept staring at the clock in her class  till it was closing time. Ada was so distracted that when her class teacher called her asked her a question,  Nkechi had to tap her before she heard.  Everyone wondered what happened to Ada. They did not know that she didn't enjoy learning with them again since she had uncle Mike. She already knew what the teacher was teaching so she didn't care. Immediately Senior Tola in basic five rang the bell,  Ada ran to the car park where Uncle Solo her mummy's driver was waiting.
P2	Uncle Mike offered her chocolate but she refused. He asked her why she didn't want the chocolate. "My mummy said that I shouldn't learn because of chocolate. I read because I was enjoying it" Ada said to uncle Mike. "Then why are you crying Ada?' he asked Ada. "Because I failed! I don't like failing!" Ada cried. "The beauty of learning is making mistakes and learning from your mistakes" he said to Ada. "So I should be failing?" Ada asked him. "No Ada. Do your best to get everything but don't be afraid or angry if you fail okay?" Uncle Mike said " Yes uncle Mike" Ada said. Ada got all her sums in mathematics and got the Mars bars. This time,  she took it because she deserved it."
