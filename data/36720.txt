P1	The big five is a group of very dangerous  animals so that  is why when you vist game reserves the team of the reserve  never allow you to walk out of their site cause they are the people who can control  the animals when they become wild
P2	Zebras  I love zebras they are the best animals cause they are harmless to me when I  picture themm they look like sweet little angles cause the other animals always  harm the little Zebras that are cut little pies that are harmless
P3	Now once upon a time there was this fun that was ruled by cheetah he ruled the rest of the big five animals  he wanted everything  to be done  his way  so the animals never gave cheetah a chance  he always felt left out by his friends
P4	So one time cheetah had to hed down the small little  hill and shout to his village they gave hinm the attention  he wanted  he then spoke you are hyprocrites he shouted what kind of people are you may I  ask you made a fool of me
P5	He went up the hill again and he said ," I want to compete against  another  animal an that will be impala ",he said Impala shooked his head and said  why me out of all saying it quietly looking  down he went to the front  and stood there
P6	Cheetah came and took impala's hand and took way up they started dancing and impala fell you are useless shouted cheetah this is why i say this kingdom is useless  how can you disappoint our kingdom like this impala you are useless impala
P7	Impala went running while opening  his wide mouth saying i hate you i hate you the animals went aside and looked at Impala  and the king was so shocked up there in the hill looking at impala embarrassing  him infront of his own kingdom
P8	Impala was threw aside by rhino crying while opening  his wide arms whining to the rest of the animals this king is useless  and you are still praising  him no one is useless said rhino  especially  my dad Cheetah holiding his dad's spear
P9	Elephant went up and took the spear and threw rhino aside with rhino frowning  alone with the other animals shifting away from rhino and lion and cheetah was shocked he decided  to cry and walk out of the kingdom he sat down and just froze
P10	He went out and frowned and climbed  the tree he stayed up the tree and sat there and left his kingdom for good and decided  to never come back
