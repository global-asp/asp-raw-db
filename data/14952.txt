page_text:

P1	Alfredo likes drawing. Since he was little,  Alfredo made drawings on the floor. He also made clay models. Alfredo's mother always says,  "Alfredo,  you are an artist!"
P2	In the first year of school,  Alfredo wanted to learn to read and to write. The other boys replied,  "Alfredo,  we will help you."
P3	In the second year of school,  Alfredo was pleased. He knew how to read and to write. He thought,  "I can already tell stories with pictures. I can draw. I want to tell many stories with drawings!"
P4	One day,  Alfredo showed his notebook to the teacher. He told a story with pictures. The teacher looked at Alfredo's notebook. She saw many beautiful drawings and said,  "Alfredo,  your notebook is very nice!"
P5	Alfredo was pleased. He thought,  "I know how to draw. I want to tell many stories with drawings!" The teacher told the class,  "Today we will all tell a story with pictures." Alfredo begins to draw quickly. "I'll tell you about the day of my birthday!" he says.
P6	The teacher calls,  "Come,  see all of Alfredo's drawings. They are so nice!" All the boys and girls agree,  "Alfredo can draw very well! Alfredo knows how to tell beautiful stories!"
P7	All the boys and girls ask,  "Alfredo,  can you draw for us? Alfredo,  tell more stories with pictures!" The teacher says,  "Alfredo,  you have to teach us how to draw. We all want to learn."
P8	Alfredo is happy. He thinks,  "Now I will be the drawing teacher for all the boys and girls. Even the teacher wants to learn to draw like me!" The teacher says,  "Alfredo,  now you just need to learn to write better,  without mistakes. You can be a great writer!"
P9	A story by Alfredo is chosen to go in a magazine. The teacher and the director show the magazine to all the students. The teacher says,  "Alfredo is now a writer!"
