page_text:

P1	My name is Havilah. I have a stuffed hedgehog; just like the one in this picture I named Miss Tiggy-winkles. I cuddle her when I go to bed.@@She reminds me of Beatrix Potter's  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
P2	My name is Giovanni. I have a stuffed butterfly I named Wind. I go to bed with Wind.  Wind is my favorite stuffed insect.@Butterflies  likes to flap their wings gently when they flutter in the sky.
P3	We like climbing trees and sometimes plucking fruits. It is fun to swing on the branches.  Fruits are sweet and sometimes sour. @@We have never eaten  bitter fruits before; have you?
P4	We think this  elephant is thirsty and wants to drink water. @@Elephants have 2 eyes, 4 legs, 2 BIG ears, 2 tusks, 1 LONG trunk and a wagging tail.
P5	We think these hyenas in the desert are building a tower that looks like the Eiffel tower, so they can reach the sky to tickle the clouds with their laughter and make it rain.
P6	Ladybugs can fly. When they fly around, they make sounds like this; "bzzzzzz!" we think they like flowers too.
P7	Bumblebees buzz around when they fly just like ladybugs.
P8	Dragonflies have four wings, they buzz around too like ladybugs and dragonflies.@@Let's google to find out more about these animals and insects.
