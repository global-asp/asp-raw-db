page_text:

P1	Not so long I moved in with my family in our new home in Forest City. I am Lucas I am 16 years old, I like reading, dancing and singing.My dad's name is Ben, my mom Casey, my brother Tony and my baby sister Becky.
P2	We are the Smith family,we are new in the neighborhood and our neighbours are the Barbara family.There is an old child she is 16 years old and we are in the same class.They invited us to a suprise welcoming party for us.
P3	I can't wait for the party,I gotta get ready for school or else I will will be late.Dad shouts "Come on Lucas you can't be late on your first day"! I get into dad's car I pick a funny conversation on the radio.
P4	The conversation is about a creature that they believed existed,I take dad's phone and research about it.We pass a bridge and hear a funny sound in the river it sounds like a beast.
P5	I tell Dad and he says I am exaggerating there is nothing like a vapour beast "just forget about it kid" says dad ,but I still feel curious. I get to school and I see Nina my neighbour with her friends talking about the vapour beast.
P6	I get to class we learn,read,write and count.We also take about extinction.At  last school has ended and I gotta walk home boom! it is raining and I am calling Dad he is not answering his phone I walk home.
P7	There is a wailing and shadow on the bridge, I look down and there was nothing.Dad finally arrives he has a project to rebuild the bridge and it is happening on the housewarming party's day.
P8	Today I woke up and it's Saturday,we are having the housewarming party at the park right under the bridge.We eat and dance and me,Nina and Tom are friends.It is now 21:00 and me,Nina and Tom are alone at the park gazing at the skies.
P9	Suddenly there was a shadow and a screaming sound we froze like ice.My heart was beating faster I was screaming in my heart,a large and scary hairy and smelly animal like human being.We stood up and in a flash I was at home.
P10	I told mom and dad it seemed like they didn't believe me at all until it was flooded in the news that a security guard saw the creature and called the police the creature had escaped and caused an accident.
P11	Everyone in Forest City discovered that their lives would be changed and they would be scared to go outside and see the creature,we were so amazed to know the extinct creature is still alive.@The end
