P1	Once upon a time there lived a cunning fox. The fox was very cunning and loved to eat small chicks. @@Lank gelede was daar ‘n skelme jakkals gewees. Hierdie jakkals was baie slinks en was lief om kuikens te eet.
P2	One day, he saw a hen with her chicks. That is when he got the best idea ever! He was going to eat the hen’s chicks.@Eendag sien hy haar met haar kuikens. Dis toe hy die briljanste ideë ooit kry! Hy gaan die haan sê kuikens eet.
P3	He decided to distract the hen first. He pretended to be her friend. @Hy besluit toe om die haan se aandag af te lei. Hulle’s kamstig vriende.
P4	“Hey, Hen. You look tired. Why don’t you go rest for a bit? I will look after your chicks.” Smirked the fox.@“Hello, Haan. Jy lyk moeg. Hoekom gaan rus jy nie bietjie nie? Ek sal na jou kuikens kyk.” Glimlag die jakkals skelm.
P5	Little did he know that Hen suspected him. “No, dear Fox. There is no need for that. I will look after my chicks.” Min weet hy dat die Haan hom vermoed. “Nee, liewe Jakkals. Daar is geen nood. Ek sal na my kuikens kyk.”
P6	Later that evening, when everyone was sleeping. Fox crept into Hen’s cage. He was going to eat the chicks tonight he thought.@Later daardie aand, toe almal slaap. Kruip Jakkals in die gaan se hok. Venaand gaan hy die kuikens eet dink hy.
P7	“Ahhh.” shouted Fox. The dog that is Hen’s friend bit Fox. He bit Fox so hard that Fox had to run away.@“Aaaa.” skreeu Jakkals. Die hond wat bevriend is saam die Hen het vir Jakkals gebyt. Hy het vir Jakkals so hard gebyt hy moes weggehol.
P8	“Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help.” said Hen to the dog. “No problem Hen, I’m glad to help.”said the dog.@“Baie dankie. Ek waardeer jou help opreg.” sê haan vir die hond. “Geen probleem, eks bly om te help.” sê die hond.
P9	After that night, Hen made sure that her chicks were always safe. And she and the dog became great friends. The end.@Na daardie aand, het Haan seker gemaak dat haar kuikens veilig is. Sy en die hond het ook goeie vriende geword. Die einde.
P10	Once there was a sly fox. He loved eating chicks. One day he saw a Hen and decided to make her chicks his target. Little did he know his plans were not going to work…
P11	Eendag was daar ‘n skelme jakkals. Hy was lief om kuikens te eet. Eendag sien hy vir Haan en besluit om haar kuikens te teiken te maak. Min weet hy dat sy plan eintlik nie gaan werk nie…
