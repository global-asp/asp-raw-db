page_text:

P1	My village has goats. 

It is far from big cities.
P2	Mother said, “Elly, we have a present for your sixth birthday.”
P3	Mother, aunt and I waited for the bus.
P4	I sat on mother’s lap. 

I slept the whole way.
P5	We reached the market. 

I saw a beautiful blue helicopter.
P6	One stall had fruits. 

I asked mother, “Which ones are these?”
P7	Mother said, “These are apples.” 

I begged, “Please, buy me one.”
P8	I forgot my mother’s hand. 

I thought only of my apple.
P9	When I finished eating, I was alone. 

I started to cry.
P10	A woman took me where there were other children.
P11	I thought children were sold at the market. 

I cried more.
P12	A man asked, “Where is Elly?”

I hid away from him.
P13	My mother’s familiar voice called, “Elly!” 

I was very happy.
P14	My aunt pulled out a beautiful helicopter. 

“It's yours!” she said.
