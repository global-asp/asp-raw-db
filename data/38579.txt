P1	Tears with a smile@@Laying awake with tears@pain has always been my biggest fear@nobody can see through the pain@so i give a smile that's fake@@Tears with a smile that lasts a while@bleeding from inside that's making me lose my mind
P2	Goodbye@I never seem to really cry,@all I can think of is why?@not good at goodbyes@@So afraid of what I'm facing,@standing here with a heart that's aching@goodbye for now,@keep an eye on me from above. and I'll make you proud
