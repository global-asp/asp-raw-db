desc:	The crayons who lived happily started to argue about who was the most important.

page_text:

P1	The crayons lived happily together in a magical kingdom, until one day.....a problem arose.
P2	Red Crayon spoke up and said that he was the most important colour because red represented the colour of love.
P3	Blue Crayon, who was rather annoyed, interrupted Red Crayon and clearly said that because blue was the colour of the sky and the sea, he had to be more important.
P4	Not to be out done, was Yellow Crayon who believed that his importance outweighed everyone because yellow was the colour of the splendid sun.
P5	Orange Crayon, who was listening quietly, stood up and said in his most noble voice that orange had to be more superior than all the other colours because orange was the colour of the roaring, burning fire.
P6	Suddenly, Green Crayon pushed forward making himself heard by telling everyone that without green there would be no green grass or beautiful green trees.
P7	Pink and Purple Crayons, who were rather shy, quickly spoke up in their tiny, calm voices saying that it was pink and purple that made everyone happy by spreading joy with their colours.
P8	The fairy princess who was listening to the argument gathered her crayon friends. She told the crayons that they were all special, for it was when the colours came together as one that a beautiful rainbow would make everyone smile.
