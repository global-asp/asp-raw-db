page_text:

P1	There once lived a king in the southern part of Okugbe Island. This king had not known pain in his life. 

Not even for a minute.
P2	One morning he was imagining what pain would be like. His head was bowed, "There are so many poor people in my land. How can I feel their pain?" he asked himself.
P3	Day and night, he wished he could experience pain just once. 

Then one night, he dreamed and heard a voice. "I have heard your wishes. You will experience pain," said the voice.
P4	The voice continued, "Build seven large boats that can contain all your wealth and family. Then sail away to the northern part of Okugbe Island." 

The king was very happy.
P5	Soon, the seven boats were built and ready to sail. The king loaded them with his wealth.
P6	The day before the king and his family left, he held a feast. Everyone attended. Leopards, snakes, rabbits, snails, birds and even ants came to the feast.
P7	The king addressed the people, "My family and I are going away to the other part of Okugbe Island. We want to feel the pain that other people feel."
P8	People whispered amongst themselves. The elders did not believe him. 

But who could question the king? So everyone drank and feasted.
P9	The next day, the king and his family sailed away.

For the first two days, the boats rolled through the waters. The sky was clear, the sea was calm and the trip was a happy one.
P10	On the third day, the sea became rough. The sky became cloudy. A great storm came upon them. 

The boats were overturned. The king was helpless as his wealth and family were lost to the sea.
P11	The king alone survived. But he was now a kingfisher bird. 

Kingfisher flew to the shore. He still hoped to get his family and wealth back from the sea.
P12	Kingfisher dived into the sea many times. He was not able to rescue his family or even part of his wealth. 

"If only I had known, I would have been happy with my life," he cried silently.
