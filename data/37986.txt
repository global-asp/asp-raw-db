page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was a pig that fell in love with a dove. It was love at first sight. A few days later they got married. They had a child named Wizi. Wizi was a pig with dove wings.
P2	He liked gobbling his parents' toes, but his parents did not like it, so they taught him to gobble the Someone's toes. The Someone was a human that lived close by them, and every morning Wizi would go and gobble his toes.
P3	"Mum I is going to gobble someone's toes ok." Wizi always says in the morning "ok sweety just don't get caught."
P4	When Wizi was older he went to school  "Mum I is going to gobble Someone's toes then go to school" he said "oh my, my big big boys first day of school, good luck my boy." And Wizi was off with his lunch of apples and bird seed.
P5	"Hi my name is Wizi what is your name?" He said to everyone, but everyone ignored him, everyone except a group of four friends.
P6	"Hi my name is Wango" said a dum fat flamingo with weird eyes. "Hi my name is Twizy and Twazy" said the money twins at the same time, they are very creepy. "Hi, uh, my, name, is, Pruney"
P7	Said the prune who is just a prune that can talk and walk. "Hi will you guys be ma friends" said wizi "of course" said Wango Wizi was happy after school he told his mom all about his friends and school.
P8	One day Wizis friends came to his house for a playdate, when they were playing Wizi caught site of Wangos toes he stared for a moment then ran and bit his toe! "Ow" shouted Wango "ow ow owâ€¦..waaaaaaahhhhhh mommy mommyyyyy"
P9	"uh, oh, I is so sorry Wango sorry" pleaded Wizi "I hate you you are the worst why did I even make friends with you!" Screamed Wango. His mom came and took him home, the twins and pruney did not like Wizi any more so they went home.
P10	Wizi was sad and ran away he got lost and sat on a log feeling very sad.@@@@@@@@@@Then he got so angry he stomped around and said "why is I so naughty I ruined the fun"
P11	Then he ran further and further away from home. Then he saw a light, he went towards it and you won't believe what he saw "wow!" Wizi said in amazement "it is so shiny" "is it is it g g g gold!!!!"
P12	"Wow" he thought to himself. Then suddenly a bunch of weasels came, wizi hid around the corner and listened "chuck, snoopy come we have found it'' said willy the master of the weasels "what" said snoopy "thes golds yous sillys"
P13	said chuck he has a weird way of talking "no not ordinary gold, the kings gold. Now get your bags and pack them full!"
P14	"Hahaha" willy shouted "oks" said chuck. Knowing that the kings gold is special he thought of a plan. "oh no they are going to steal the kings gold I better stop them" "I got plan I will gobble their toes!"
P15	So he pounced and ate their toes "aaahhhh help me" shouted snoopy "rrruunnsss" screamed chuck. But willy was not afraid of a pig and wizi was not afraid of a weasel and they ran to eachother and bit squealed and hist but then wizi saw
P16	his but and thought "maybe it will be more sore if I gobbled his but" so he did and did not let go willy screeaaaammeeedd  and ran away.
P17	By the time the king's army came, they saw that wizi already saved the treasure, wizi was a hero. The king gave wizi a golden hat that said "I saved the king," and he gave him a whole bunch of gold "thank you thank you so much"
P18	squealed wizi, and when he went home, his mom rushed to see if he was ok. @@@"Are you ok, where were you, where did you get this gold? Did you steal it?" "No ma I saved the king's gold" said wizi to his mom
P19	"well done" said his mom in a disbelieving tone. But then it was all over the radio. The next day wizi's  friends came "we are so sorry wizi, but well done for gobbling that weasels but," said Wango "thanks, I is so sorry I didnt mean too"
P20	Said Wizi "how about we play kings with my golden crowns? "yay" Wango said, and they had a wonderful time and wizi saved the day. THE END!!!!!!
