page_text:

P1	One day King Leopard decided to host a sports event in the jungle. @@He called upon all the animals and told them the exciting news.
P2	"We are playing a game of javelin!" said the King as he held up the javelin stick and showed it to the animals. @@The animals looked shocked to see such an object.
P3	Elephant came barging through the crowd when he saw the javelin.@@"King, I know this game, let me go first!" shouted Elephant. @@He pushed all the other animals out of his way to get closer to the King.
P4	The King gave Elephant the javelin. Elephant took the javelin and tried to throw it as far as possible. @@Unfortunately, he missed and it landed flat on the ground.
P5	This is when Warthog also decided to give it a shot. He threw the javelin as far as he could but he also missed. @@This javelin terrified the other animals. They made sure they were out of the way each time it was thrown.
P6	Baboon came along and attempted to throw but nothing worked.@@It seemed as if nobody could play this game.
P7	The King was about to cancel the sports event, when Antelope came running from the back of the crowd.@@"Stop! Don't cancel the game, I'll show you how it's done," said Antelope.
P8	"Well, you have only one chance to make this right or else I'm canceling the game," the King said. @@Antelope then kneeled before the king and accepted the deal. She promised not to disappoint anyone.
P9	With one shot only Antelope landed the javelin into the ground, making a perfect score.@@This shocked everyone as they didn't expect it at all. Antelope had kept her promise and had saved the sports day.
P10	King Leopard held Antelope by the hand and cheered her on for hours. @@Even though sports day was saved for everyone,  the jealous animals all looked upset.@@Who knew Antelope had skills!
