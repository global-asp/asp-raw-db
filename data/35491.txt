P1	Once upon a time in a Town far way, the people in that town have a habit of laughing at anyone that they think is not perfect in their eyes.
P2	They laugh at the postman, because he walks with a lump. They laugh at Mr Bird, because he has one eye. They laugh at Chocolate, because she use her wheelchair to get around. They laugh at Vanilla, because he stammers when he talks.
P3	One day, a stranger moved into the town.Each time the stranger would go out, he would wear a white mask to cover the left side of his face. The town people would laugh so hard each time they see him. Some would even go so far as throwing
P4	stones at him. The stranger however was  determine that no matter what the Town people did to him, he wasn't letting their ignorance drive him away.
P5	A few months later, all the citizens of the Town, were ordered to attend a fire safety meeting at the Town Hall.
P6	That morning before the meeting, the Town's people were informed by radio that there will be a special guest speaker at the fire safety meeting.
P7	The people were excited and happy, they were all thinking that the special guest speaker must be someone very important.
P8	Every seat at the Town Hall was filled that evening. The Mayor stood up and informed the Town people that the special guest speaker has something important to share with them. The Town people looked at each other and laughed.
P9	Slowly, the stranger made his way to the front of the room. The stranger had removed the white mask that covered the burned disfigured left side of his face. The Town's people gasped, some turned away in shame, some held each others hand
P10	as they fight away the tears rolling down their faces.
P11	The stranger began, " My name is Aba Lopez and I am a retired fire fighter, two years ago, I was burned on my face in a house fire, while saving the life of a mother and her young child".
P12	As the Town people listened and cried, they learned an important lesson that evening and promised never to laugh at anyone again. THE END
