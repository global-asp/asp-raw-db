page_text:

P1	Long ago, there lived a couple in a village. @@One day, they slaughtered their sheep and cooked the meat in a pot.
P2	They did not eat the cooked mutton yet. Instead, they went to the field. @@They wanted to get grass to use as toothpicks.
P3	On the way, they met a man. They told him about the meat.@@"But do not go to our house to eat," they added.
P4	However, the man went directly to their home and found the pot. @@He ate all the meat and left an empty pot.
P5	The couple returned to their house later. @@They found the empty pot surrounded by a swarm of flies.
P6	They were very surprised. @@"It must be those flies that ate all the meat," concluded the couple.
P7	Later on, one of the flies perched on the woman's nose. @@She told her husband to hit that fly and kill it.
P8	So the man got a big stick and hit his wife's nose.@@The fly escaped but the woman did not!
