P1	Hlompho ene ele ngoanana ea motle haholo le nkhono oa hae ele nkhono ea lerato. Hlompho was a very beautiful girl,  with a very loving Grandmother.
P2	Nkhono oa Hlompho o ne a mo etstetsa lithethatana tse ntle ka mehla le mehla. Hlompho o ne a li rata haholo. Hlompho's grandmother would always make her traditional beaded dresses. Hlompho loved them very much.
P3	Banana bao e neng e leng bananana ba bapalang le Hlompho ba ne ba rata lithethana tsa hae feela ba ba sa rate ka moo li mo ts'oanelang ka teng. Ba ne ba le mona ebile ba rata lithethana tsa Hlompho. Ba ne ba batla ho mo amoha tsona ka tsatsi le leng,  The girls that Hlompho played with,  loved her traditional beaded dresses,  but they didn't like the way they suited her. They were jealous,  but they loved Hlompho's traditional beaded dresses. They wanted to steal them from her one day.
P4	Eaba ka tsatsi le leng Hlompho le bananana bao,  ba tsamaea ho ea sesa nokeng e haufi. Ba fihla ba siea lithethana tsa bona kaofeela ka thoko ho noka eaba ba keena metsing ho sesa le ho bapala ba iketlile. One day,  Hlompho & the girls went to go swim in the river,  nearby. They all left their traditional beaded dresses next to the river & they went in the water to swim & play.
P5	Eitse hang ho re ba qete ho sesa ka hare ho noka,  e mong oa banana bao a nka thethana ea Hlompho a lahlela hole le moo ba neng ba sesa teng moo ho neng ho na le noha ea metsi. Hlompho eaba o setse a hlobotse e le sono antse a lla. As soon as they had finished swimming,  one of the girls took Hlompho's traditional beaded dress & threw it far from where they were swimming,  where they lived a snake. Hlompho was left naked,  sad & crying.
P6	Noha e kholo eile ea utloa seboko sa motho e mong ea ntseng a lla eaba noha ena e hohobela kantle ho metsi. Eare ha e hlaha ea bona Hlompho eaba e mo hula ka leleme e mo akhela ka mpeng 'moho le thethana ea hae. The big snake heard the loud crys of someone & it came out of the water. To find Hlompho & it pulled her with its tongue & swallowed her,  along with her traditional beaded dress.
P7	Ka bomalimabe noha ena ene e sa rate tatso ea thethana ea Hlompho. Eare ha e fihla ha eona ea hlatsa Hlompho le thethana ea hae. Eaba Hlompho o paqama pela noka; a ikupelitse ka mathe a noha a nkhang ha mpe. Fortunately the snake did not like the taste of Hlompho. When it arrived at its home,  it spat Hlompho & her traditional dress out. Hlompho layed down by the river; covered in the snakes spit,  that smelled bad.
P8	Hlompho a matha a ea hae Batsoaling ba hae a ntse a nkha joalo. Hlompho ran home to her parents,  still smelling bad.
P9	Ompulele lemati,  ke nkha hampe Ompulele lemati,  ke nkha hampe Ke nkha hampempe Ba matha ho tsoela kantle ho ntlo. Ba binela Hlompho pina joalo kaha 'Me oa hae a neng a mo binela: Tloha mona,  o oa nkha Tloha mona,  o oa nkha Tloha mona on kha hampe mpe. Open the door,  I smell bad Open the door,  I smell bad I smell very bad They ran out of the house. Singing to Hlompho just like the way her mother sang to her: Go away,  you smell Go away,  you smell Go away,  you smell very bad.
P10	Hlompho a utloa bohloko haholo. A matha ho tloha mono ntlong,  a mathela ha rakhali le rangoane oa hae,  Ba mo utloa a ntse a bina a re "thuso" "thuso hleng"! Hlompho was very hurt. She ran away from the house,  to her aunt & uncles house. They heard her shouting "Help,  help please!"
P11	Ompulele lemati,  ke nkha hampe Ompulele lemati,  ke nkha hampe Ke nkha hampe mpe. Ba matha ho tsoela kantle ho ntlo. Ba binela Hlompho pina joalo kaha 'Me oa hae a neng a mo binela: Tloha mona,  o oa nkha Tloha mona,  o oa nkha Tloha mona o nkha hampe mpe. Open the door,  I smell bad Open the door,  I smell bad They ran outside of the house. They started singing to her just like her Mother used to sing to her: Go away,  you smell Go away,  you smell Go away,  you smell very bad.
P12	Hlompho o ne a salletsoe ke tulo e le ngoe feela moo a ka eang teng. Feela pelo ea hae ka nako ena e e ne e se le bohloko haholo. Hlompho o ne a se a lahlehetsoe ke ts'epo ebile a sa nahane hore ho na na le motho ea tla amohelang monkho oa hae. Hlompho was left with only one house to go to. But her feelings were very hurt by now. Hlompho had lost all hope,  and she did not think anyone would accept her bad smell.
P13	Eaba Hlompho o khutlela ha Nkhono oa hae a ntse a nkha joalo.a ena le letsoalo hore Nkhono le eena o tla mo tebela. Feela Nkhono a mo amohela. So Hlompho went back to her Grandmother,  still smelling very bad. And afraid that her Grandmother will also chase her away. But Grandmother accepted her.
P14	Hlompho a lula le nkhono oa hae lilemo tse ngata. Ka tsatsi le leng a kopana le mora oa Morena oa motseng o haufi. Mora oa Morena a ba a kopa Hlompho ho mo nyala. Hlompho lived with her Grandmother for many years. One day she met with the son of a Chief from a village nearby. The Chief's son asked Hlompho to marry him.
P15	Eaba batsoali ba Hlompho ba utloa ka taba ea lenyalo,  ba kopa Hlompho hore a khutlele lapeng hape. Hlompho's parents heard about the marriage,  & they asked Hlompho to come back home.
P16	Hlompho a hlapanya hore le ka tsatsi la mohlolo hore ha tlo tsamaea le batho ba sa kang ba mo bonts'a lerato. Hlompho a hopotsa batsoali hore lerato la motsoali ha le feele. Hlompho swore that no matter what,  she will not go with people who did not show her any love. Hlompho reminded her parents that a parents love never ends.
P17	Ho tloha mono eaba Hlompho o mema Nkhono oa hae hore atle atlo lula le ena le monna oa hae. From then on,  Hlompho invited her Grandmother to come & live with her & her husband.
P18	Nkhono o ne a thabile haholo hape a lokolohile ka hohle hape a amohela ho lula le setloholo sa hae ho ea ho ile. Grandmother was very happy,  & very willing to live with her grandaughter forever.
