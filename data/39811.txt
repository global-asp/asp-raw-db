page_text:

P1	Bobby is a 7 year old girl who wishers to be a guide one day. Her teacher told their class to prepare themselves for the following day for the trip. Bobby was very excited as she always wanted to explore her home town.
P2	On the day of the trip Bobby was up very early as she wanted to be the first at school. Now Bobby is a very bright girl and always said the idiom "the earliest bird catches the biggest worm" meaning you're most likely to get what you want.
P3	Bobby was first to get on and off first the bus. Their first stop was the Hester Rupert Art Museum. Here they witnessed a collection of South African artists' work that is quite unique  which stretch back to the mid century years.
P4	They then stopped at the Reinet house, a beautifully restored Manor house filled with antiques and stories of the past and the people who founded the town.
P5	After this they went to the Dutch Reformed Church known as the Groot Kerk which stands majestically in the middle of the town.
P6	They then went to the Nqweba dam and took a stroll over the bridge.
P7	Their second last stop was the Camdeboo Park where they saw some beautiful animals like the mountain zebra; and had a lovely peaceful picnic.
P8	Just before sunset they went to the Valley to see the magnificent rock formations and long views of Spandaukop and the Karoo.
P9	Afterwards they all went home and Bobby could not stop talking about her extraordinary experience. Her quote was " this was the most spectacular day of my life, since my birth day" @@The end.
