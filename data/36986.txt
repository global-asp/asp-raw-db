P1	Once upon a time,there was a man named Mike. There was an old lady, that Mike always used to go and see him she insulted him so bad that she put a curse on him.
P2	He was so angry, he threw a book at her. She was so angry, at him she said that he would have a son and his son grow up like him, he was so sad to hear this.
P3	One day he went back to her house and said I'm sorry for what I did the last day, please can you forgive me and let my son be normal and the next day when he woke up he was back to normal and he was dreaming of how he was when he was tall.
