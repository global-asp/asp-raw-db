desc:	Our family day trip to Tombs of the Kings

page_text:

P1	Today we went on a trip to an archaeological site called Tombs of the Kings.@@It is a place where nobles and aristocrats long long ago were buried. @@The heritage site had lots of tombs carved out of solid rock.
P2	There were so many different tombs to see, some were a little stuffy and we sneezed a lot, one tomb we climbed through a small passageway to get to the other side.
P3	We did a lot of walking.
P4	Daddy packed us some yummy strawberries. They were so scrumptious, I had so many and got all my clothes so messy.
P5	My favourite part of the day was when we stopped for a break and I got to play in the sand.
P6	There were pretty wild flowers all around the site, different yellow ones and purple ones too.
P7	By the time we finished our walk, we were all so very tired.
