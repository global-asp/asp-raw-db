page_text:

P1	Lorton is an 8 year old boy. He has a sweet tooth and would do absolutely anything for a treat!
P2	One day after cleaning his room, he decided to go looking for a treat. Little did he know that it would turn into a big adventure.
P3	Lorton started in mommy and daddy's room. He remembered seeing a cookie tin. @He could already smell the butter rich biscuits.
P4	He spotted the red tin and licked his lips, as he  opened it. Can you imagine his disappointment when he found a sewing kit where his cookies were meant to be?
P5	Lorton needed a treat and that meant thinking harder about where he could find it.@@'Oh yes, Nanna has sweeties in her special draw'
P6	He made sure to look left and right before sneaking into his older sister's room. @He went to her special draw' and pulled it out slowly, looking for her golden sweet tin.
P7	His mouth was watering. He could smell the fruity flavours. @@'Oh NO, this can't be!'@@In the sweet tin, were  fruit scented hairbands instead of candy.
P8	Lorton had to think really hard about where he could possibly find something sweet.@@'I know, I can have some ice cream!'@@Off he went to the freezer, to finally get his 'well deserved' treat.
P9	Lorton took a dessert bowl from the kitchen cupboard and an ice cream spoon. @@He opened the ice cream tub and was about to take a big scoop, when he realized...@@...instead of ice cream, it was granny's left over breyani!
P10	'Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgggggg!!!!! Not Again!
P11	Lorton's family ran to his rescue. 'What happened," asked his mom.@"All I wanted was a treat, but instead of cookies, I found a sewing kit. Instead of sweets, I found hairbands. Instead of ice cream, frozen rice!"
P12	'Well, all you had to do was ask," said his mom as she handed him one of his favourite chocolate brownie bars.@@@The adventure was long and disappointing but definitely worth the wait!
