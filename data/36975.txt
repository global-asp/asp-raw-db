page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there lived an evil demon king named Hiranyaksh. He was son of Great sage Kashyap and his wife Diti.@He was very powerful but he misused his powers by doing wrong deeds. He used to trouble innocent people with no reason.
P2	Lord Varah Avatar@@Lord Vishnu took this incarnation to protect Goddess Earth.
P3	Hiranyaksh was very cruel but also powerful. All people living on Earth were under his control, he also defeated the demigods and concurred the heaven. Soon ne became the lord of all three worlds.
P4	As the time passed, he bacame more arrogant and an evil thought came to his mind. He then went inside the ocean and hid the earth there. Everyone became worried but no one had the courage to fight with Hiranyaksh.
P5	Then all the worried demigods went to Lord Vishnu and told him to protect the earth from the hands of evil hiranyaksh. Lord Vishnu was pleased by their prayers and came from Lord brahma's nose, in form of varah which means boar.
P6	All the demigods then worshiped Lord Varah and requested him to save the earth. He then went inside the ocean and bought the earth outside.
P7	When Hiranyaksh saw this, he challenged Lord Varah for a war. The lord accepted his challenge and fought with him.
P8	A long time passed, but the war seemed to be a never-ending one. But after a long time the lord killed Hiranyaksh and saved goddess earth. Like this, Lord Varah established the power of righteousness in the world.
P9	He then promised goddess earth, he said "Whenever righteousness will decrease, I will manifest myself from age to age. To rescue saintly people, To destroy wicked people and to save the righteousness".
P10	From that time, goddess earth is considered to be wife of Lord Varah. In future, she incarnated in Dwapar yug in form of Satyabhama and became wife of Lord Vishnu's Krishna avatar.
