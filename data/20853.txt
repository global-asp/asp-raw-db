page_text:

P1	There was once an old woman living by herself inside a bottle. She complained all the time.
P2	One day a fairy passed by her home and saw her looking very sad.
P3	The fairy stopped and asked her, "What is the problem? Why are you so sad?"
P4	"I am tired of living in a bottle," replied the old lady.
P5	The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
P6	After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a small house.
P7	After a few days the fairy came back and found the woman still unhappy.
P8	The fairy asked her, "What is wrong now? Why are you sad?"
P9	"This house is too small. I do not like it," responded the old woman.
P10	The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
P11	After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself in a big house.
P12	The fairy came to see the old woman again. She found her still unhappy and grumpy.
P13	The fairy asked her, "What is wrong old lady?" The old lady responded, "This house is dark and dirty."
P14	The fairy said to her, "Stand up, clap your hands twice, and turn around three times."
P15	After doing what she was told to do, the old woman found herself back inside the bottle.
P16	The old woman could not see the blessings she received. She ended up in her bottle, alone and unhappy.
