page_text:

P1	Dry dusty old big empty school in the middle of an abandoned town.Big gates rusting away brick walls surrounding the school some say boring some say haunted by ghosts of the dead children in the middle of the night they scream for 1 minute
P2	Maybe that's true maybe it's totally nonsense but today we fined out the truth the gates are old and rusty you can kick it down you kick the gates down effortlessly and walk down the path looking around you get to the doors as you reach out
P3	And as you continue to push the door you here a screen but a short one so you proceed to open the door finally open a strong gust of wind pushes you back but you get though the force and in to the old school and shut the door.
P4	Out of breath you look around left ,them right.you notice the rusting old lockers falling down the dust and webs the chewed paper everything falls on you the end
