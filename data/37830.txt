P1	Once upon a time there was a girl named Tara and she was from a village called Tintagel. She was only 10 years old, she had a friend called Sorsha. Sorsha was Tara's best friend they played together and did everything together.
P2	Tara's mother name was Miss Evie. Tara's father died when she was 6 and her mother did everything she could to make Tara not to remember her father because if she does remember her father she will only become sad. One day it was midnight
P3	and Tara's mother wanted to cook dinner, Tara invited Sorsha for dinner but there wasn't fire woods. Tara felt disappointed because she wanted to have a great time with her friend.
P4	A few minutes later, why don't we go and fetch some fire woods in the forest said Sorsha. Yes that can work but we're in the middle of the night we can't possibly go to the forest by this time said Tara, I agree with Tara you guys can't go
P5	said miss Evie. But this is the only planet that we have and it is only plan that we have to use said Sorsha. I agree with Sorsha in this one, plus this is the only plan that we have mum please us let us go the forest will be back very soon
