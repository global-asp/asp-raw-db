page_text:

P1	There lived a beautiful girl. One day she was very hungry. She thought of ways of getting something to eat.
P2	She met a man who asked her, "How are you young girl? What makes you sad?" The girl answered, "I am hungry."
P3	The man was sorry for the girl. He told her there was a feast in the neighbourhood and she should go and steal food. The girl had never stolen before.
P4	The girl stood up quickly and went to the home that was holding the feast.
P5	When she got near, she forgot the instructions on how to steal. She sang repeatedly:
I have come to steal food, f-o-o-d,
I am walking slowly, slo-wly
P6	People heard the song of the girl from far until she got into the homestead.
P7	People were amazed by the nature of the song and asked her, "Where do you come from? What do you want? Why are you singing?"
P8	The girl told them how hungry she was and they gave her food.

Later, she was advised that stealing is bad!
