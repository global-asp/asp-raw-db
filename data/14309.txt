P3	I reach home and find my sister Mimo.I told her  my goodnews."Dad and mom will be happy for you Uche, "She told me.
P4	I woke up earlier the following  day to start the day's duties.I went to feed the chicken and fetch the eggs with the help of Mimo.
P5	We later walked to where we keep rabbits to feed them. Mimo and Kilonzi my friend helped in feeding while I made sure that the rabbits had enough water for the day.
P6	That night after taking  supper, our father told us good news that we were going to visit a Zoo on Saturday. We were happy since we have never been there before.
