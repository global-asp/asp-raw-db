P1	when it was mid-night i decided to go for a nap,i fell asleep easily but when i woke up i was in the woods,a forest filled with huge trees and a warm shining sun was welcoming me to my next day. It was insanely beautiful but,
P2	I was shocked,how did I end up in the forest when I was sleeping in my bed?! I got up and splashed my face with cold water from the lake,I also drank some and I felt more energetic! The problem was that I was starving and my stomach couldn'
P3	stop growling. Lucky me I found some there some nuts in that forest and,atleast I wasn't starving anymore.I wasn't just gonna stand there so I went for a walk in the fresh beautiful nature. When I walked near a tree,I thought I was dreaming
P4	It talked! The tree asked me:@"Are you the long lost princess the king was looking for? You were kidnapped by an old witch lady!"@I was shocked to hear that! Was my mother a witch?@"Her name was Clarice Cherrith with long brown hair and..
P5	intimidating eyes" said the talking tree@It was actually my mom! I replied:@"I know now! Thank you for telling me it could've tell me everything by her weird personality but I didn't see that cuz I thought she was my mom,but me? Royalty?
P6	"Of course the king and queen told me to look out for you since that witch kindapped you! He told me every detail possible about you" said the tree@"Well,could I meet them now? Can you tell me where the castle is?" @"Alright, you see that
P7	small house there?go from there to the left,keep going after left again and then right."@"Thank you so much big tree!"@When I got to the castle,I was my real mother and father. I hugged them tightly and they hugged me back.My mom
P8	kissed my forehead and said:@"We were trying so hard to find where were you living with Clarice (the witch) and this miracle happens,I love you and so does your dad."@After those sweet talking,we lived happily ever after.@@The end
