P2	While, Ameerah  was the opposite because  she was not interested in going to school none to acquire education.
P3	Maryam  continue to advice her friend Ameerah to go to school. She even told  her the importance of girl child education but Ameerah will always  tell her not to disturb her life.
P4	Maryam  continued schooling, finished and got married. One day, Maryma  visited their village and  Ameerah saw her in a beautiful car. She now remembered how her friend  has been pleading with her to take her studies seriously.
