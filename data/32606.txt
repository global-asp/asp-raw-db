page_text:

P1	We are punctuation marks. @@We are the superheroes found on Sentence Street!@@We will show you how and where to use punctuation in sentences.@@Let us guide you in reading and writing. @@We will help you to write clear and meaningful sentences, and to read punctuation with understanding.
P2	We are nine punctuation marks who will introduce ourselves today.@@There are more of us, but you can meet them later.@@We hope you will ask us for help when making sentences.
P3	You will find me at the start of:@a list, @or a title, @or an explanation,@or to introduce something. @ @Call me: Colon.
P4	My name is Comma. I help you to pause between thoughts, and I also separate items in a list.@@I love exercising, reading and playing.@@Would you tell me about the things you love doing?
P5	Curiosity is my super power!@@My mission is to ask questions and find answers! @@Please call me Question Mark, would you?
P6	I am Semicolon; I am a guard on Sentence Street. I'm a longer pause than a comma, but I'm not a full stop. @@I sometimes play Cupid by helping lonely clauses connect and become friends instead of strangers. @@I can also separate items in a long list to avoid confusion.
P7	When a letter or two is missing from a word, I'll stand in for the letters.  @@I also show possession or that something belongs to someone.@@Call me Apostrophe.
P8	"I am Quotation Mark and my super power is direct speech!"@@When you see me wrapped around the words someone says, it means those are the exact words that the person spoke (or thought). @@I open and close quotations. Sometimes I show sarcasm.
P9	Hey there! @@I am Exclamation Mark, the emotion mark! I express strong emotions. @@I express surprise and excitement! I shout, scream, laugh hysterically and wail!@@I am always willing to help you express your strong feelings.
P10	We are three. @... 3 dots that represent missing or unsaid words.@@This happens when people are unsure of what to say next and don't complete their sentence. @@We are called ellipsis.
P11	I end sentences. I am the stop indicator. @@Without me, everyone on Sentence Street will run out of breath and need to visit a doctor often.@@My name is Period, or Full Stop.
P12	People like to say that Ellipsis and Period are cousins. @@Others say Question Mark, Exclamation Mark and Quotation Mark are siblings. @@There are those who say Comma and Apostrophe are twins.@@What do you think?
