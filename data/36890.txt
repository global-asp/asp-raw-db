P1	Mia was a girl who loved flowers. Everyday she would go to the park to smell the flowers.
P2	One day while she was at the park, she noticed dark clouds and knew it was going to rain.
P3	And it got worse. On the way home she slipped on a puddle. Mia was hurt.
P4	Then her family was worried and visited Mia at the hospital. Her mom said "thank god your'e safe Mia". Mia said she was fine but she hurt her ankle so she couldn't move and would stay at the hospital a little longer.
P5	Mia couldn't stop thinking about flowers. Mia told her mom she wanted a flower.
P6	So her mom bought her a flower and gave to her. Mia was so happy. She thanked her mom for buying her a flower.
