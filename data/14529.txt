page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a long dry spell. The animals ate all the grass in the country. Only the imbowa plants on the big trees survived.
P2	One day Goat saw Hyena pass by with a knife. Goat asked for the knife so that she could cut imbowa plants to eat.
P3	Hyena gave the knife to Goat. She cut down the climbing plant,  and ate until she was full. Goat forgot all about the knife she had used.
P4	When Hyena returned to ask for the knife,  Goat was at a loss. She could not remember where she had dropped it.
P5	Goat scratched here and there in search of the knife. Up to today Goat is still looking for that knife.
P6	Hyena told Goat,  "Since you have lost my knife,  which was the source of my livelihood,  I will eat you. Then I will eat your offspring!"
P7	From that time,  Hyena has never spared Goat.
P8	Meanwhile,  Goat continues to search for Hyena's knife.
