They had practiced the whole holiday. This was their time.

page_text:

P1	Opening school was a breathtaking! What of the many stories and other experiences we'd share in hushed tones. However, this was second term. Our new headmistress, Mrs Muchoki , had promised the pupils that upon opening, we'd particapate in
P2	games. Our mother was particularly keen to notice that my sister and I had effectively used the April holidays to exercise. Njoki, my sister, was obviously chatty, she had new skills to show off to her classmates- sixth graders.
P3	Mrs Muchoki kept her word. On the dias was our new games teacher, Miss Manzu she introduced herself and after the uproar died down, we dispersed.@At 3.00 o'clock, Miss Manzu, immaculately dressed in a shinny track suit took us to the field
P4	We had surely a lot to learn. " Mojo!" called out Miss Manzu, "we need a games captain!" I was so shocked to hear my name. To my surprise I had been elected as the games captain. I was elated and happy to work with the teacher.@We trained
P5	and in two weeks, we were ready to participate in zonal sixth graders competition.@Tuesday, 13th June , we participated in the competions. We broke old records in mixed football competition. We were crowned champions. Miss Manzu made second
P6	term our best.
