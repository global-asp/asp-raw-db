page_text:

P1	It was on a Saturday evening while watching our family's favourite programme, that we Saw breaking news of presidential briefing, that we all became courious and attentive.
P2	President announced that there has been reported one case of a Kenyan who tested positive of covid_19, a respiratory disease which was first discovered in Wuhan in China. It is rapidly spreading all over the world.
P3	He announced the closure of schools, churches and mosques, and all public gathering put on halt with immediate effect.
P4	I became very sad üòî with the news and decided to visit the library on Monday, little did I know that it was a public place where the disease can  spread rapidly and therefore it was also closed. I decided to go back home and study there.
P5	The ministry of health said that there is no vaccine found yet and scientist  all over the world are working round the clock to get the cure for covid _19. The disease is affecting all ages colour and race.
P6	Anyone tested positive for coronavirus is isolated in hospital for treatment and observation.All his contacts are traced and isolated for 14 days and later tested.
P7	All flights in and out of the country were  burned and curfew was put in place from 7Pm to 5Am.Everyone was instructed to put on masks in public ,sanitize and wash the hands for 20 seconds
P8	Kenyans have started making face masks and selling them at a cheaper price, funny enough children have started face masks using shopping bags and rubber bands, strings and bottles just to prevent the spread.
P9	As citizens we need to follow preventive measures given by the ministry  of health that includes keeping distance,eg in the market, Banks and all other social places.most important is staying at home if one has no good reason for going out.
P10	I üôèpray to God that this disease ends so that we can go back to school.@                                            „Ä∞Ô∏è  END „Ä∞Ô∏è
