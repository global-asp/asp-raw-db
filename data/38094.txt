page_text:

P1	Khukwana, Mango and Nene are best of friends. They were walking from school in the muddy road of a small village called Itumeleng. The kids looked tired on that Wednesday afternoon
P2	The village of Itumeleng hadn't seen much sun. It had been raining for months on end. The kids longed to see the sun shine on their faces. The village was full of beautiful trees around it
P3	On their way home. Walking past the forest. A shinny big oak box caught the children 's eyes. It was nicely placed under an old oak tree that was growing far from the others. The tree leaves were beautifully heart shaped.
P4	The brave kids walked towards the box creeping,tiptoe! tiptoe! tiptoe!@As Khukwana came near to the box it changed colour to blue.
P5	Mango followed Khukwana to the box. Tiptoe! tiptoe! tiptoe!@As she came near to the box it changed colour to green.
P6	In interest, Nene followed Mango too.@Tiptoe! tiptoe! tiptoe!@She came near to the box it changed colour to yellow.
P7	The kids argued among themselves about who is going to open the box.@Khukwana open the box! said Mango.@Mango said to "Nene you open it"@Open me! open me!@The kids opened the box together.@It was a beautiful shining yellow light.
P8	It was the sun@It rose back to the sky of Itumeleng village.@The children were happy to see the sun again
