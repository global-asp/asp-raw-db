P1	Mr. Do-Good lived in Gasa village. He had no children of his own. @@He loved children in the community and told them nice stories. The children loved listening to him.
P2	There was a wicked woman in the same village. She hated Mr. Do-Good for being popular with children.@@She warned her children, "If I see you near that miserable man I will punish you severely."
P3	One day, Mr. Do-Good sat near the window telling the children stories. The wicked woman saw them through the window. @@She washed her cooking pot and carried the dirty water to his compound. She poured the water on him.
P4	"Why did you do that to me?" Mr. Do-Good asked. @@The wicked woman said, "You have not seen anything yet, you miserable man! You want all the children to love you and hate the rest of us."
P5	Mr. Do Good did not stop gathering children for storytelling. He told them stories that taught good morals. @@"Never hate people for hating you," he said. He continued being nice to everyone.
P6	One day, Mr. Do-Good fell sick and nobody was there to look after him. @@He felt bad and said to himself, "How I wish I had a child!"
P7	The wicked woman's son came secretly to stay with Mr. Do-Good. He took care of him. @@Three months later, Mr. Do-Good got well.
P8	Mr. Do-Good was very happy. He thought of how  to reward the boy who looked after him.  @@He called the boy and said, "I want to give you a portion of my farm."
P9	The boy went back home and told his mother about the gift. @@She was surprised and asked her son, "Are you sure he is the same one who has promised to give you a portion of his farm?"
P10	All the villagers heard about the gift Mr. Do-Good gave the wicked woman's son. @@They all gathered at the farmland to pray for him.
P11	The wicked woman was ashamed. She cried and walked into Mr. Do-Good's compound to apologise. @@Mr. Do-Good forgave her.
P12	The woman's children were happy about the news. They became good neighbours to Mr. Do-Good and visited him always.@@ Their mother became a good woman. She lived happily with everyone ever after.
