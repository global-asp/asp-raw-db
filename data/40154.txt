P2	for her daughter. Kayla was so excited about her present that she could not wait to  go to school the following day so that she will show all her friends and her classmates what her mother had just bought for her on her birthday.
P3	Kayla had always admired and loved animals that she even asked her mother to buy an Elephant for her so that she can keep it as a pet in their house.
P4	When Kayla got to school the following day, the first thing she wanted to tell her friends about was the animal book her mother had just bought for her, She also wanted to show her class teacher who also happened to be her favourite teacher
P5	After Kayla had showed her  favourite teacher the animal book, her teacher asked 'Kayla can you please tell us how animals got their names from?
P6	Kayla was afraid to answer the question because she did not know the answer to what was asked and one of her classmates raised her and and shouted 'God gave animals their names'.
P7	then their teacher asked 'Can I all tell you a story about how animals got their names?' and they all should 'Yes, story time is always the best'@Then the teacher told the story.........
P8	'Once upon a time, many many years ago, before everyone was born, God saw how Adam was bored since Adam was the only person who was living in the world, God decided to create all kinds of animals, animals that can fly,
P9	animals that lived on the ground and also animals which lived in the sea(water), after God had created all the animals, he then brought all the animals to Adam so that he can name them one by one
P10	Adam would be like you will be called a lion, king of the jungle, then move to the next animal you'll be called Elephant up until Adam named all the animals that is how animals got their names.....
