P1	Once upon a time in the far land of Nyakiro, there lived a man called Nyamwaro. He was married to a lovely woman called Nyakiro. They were blessed with a beautiful babygirl named Gakii. The family lived together happily.
P2	After 3years, Gakii was big to start her education and she joined a nearby school. She enjoyed the company of other children and their lovely teachers. She was elected as class monitor by their class teacher.
P3	In her sixth year in school, her mum was very sick. Gakii had to drop out of school so that she can take care of her good mother. Her fellow pupils kept on visiting her and comforting her so that she can gain her strength once more.
P4	One early morning, her dad informed her that her mother Gakii could be heard screaming from a distance since she knew that her mother was no longer there for her. The burial was organized and Nyakio was laid to rest.
P5	After few years Gakii had a step-mother who treated her like a servant and treated her two daughters that she had come with as angels.Gakii explained everything to he father but he decided to side with his new wife.
P6	One day the prince was getting married and she asked all the beautiful girls around to show themselves in his palace. The step-mother prepared her daughters well but she did not bother with Gakii.
P7	After they left to the palace, a magic appeared and Gakii met herself in the palace as the most dressed and beautiful girl in the area. The prince pointed at her and she became the wife to the prince
P8	The step-mother and her two daughters left the palace very annoyed and Gakii was the most happy person regardless of her mother's loss. Since then I learned how to treat people well because you never know who they may become in future.
