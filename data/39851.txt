page_text:

P1	Salama writes a letter to her friend and it goes like this:@@Dear Furaha,@How are you? I hope you are fine. I am fine too, although, I am still recovering from an accident I had last week. @@On that day as I was riding my bike to the market, l met a speeding car at a sharp corner.
P2	Suddenly, I panicked and hit a tree. I fell down and  hurt my arm. I am lucky that my arm did not break, but only had some bruises. @@My parents took me to hospital. The doctor washed the wound with an antiseptic and bandaged my arm.
P3	My father has decided to buy me a helmet and gloves for cycling. He said that by using them, I am safer. @@I want to get well and use them. I am afraid I will get into another accident. I have shared this with you because you are my friend.
P4	Don't forget that the day after tomorrow is my birthday. Please remember to bring me mangoes when you come.
P5	I was told by the doctor to rest for a week before going back to school. I feel bad that we will not go to the market as we had planned last week. We can go together after I recover.@@Good bye for now and greet your parents.@ @Your friend, @Salama
