page_text:

P1	A long time ago,  the rabbit and the snake were good friends.
P2	One day they began to chat with each other. But the rabbit was much cleverer than the snake,  and the snake knew it!
P3	So,  they were discussing who could stare the longest. The snake said,  "Let's try it. I will win by staring at you." So the rabbit agreed to the staring game.
P4	The snake and the rabbit began to stare. They kept on doing it for several minutes.
P5	Then the snake got tired. So he got out of his body and only his skin was left looking at the rabbit.
P6	The rabbit continued looking at the snake's skin for several hours.
P7	The rabbit thought he was the cleverest animal,  but on that day,  his cleverness was ended. And that's why to this day the rabbit sleeps with his eyes open!
