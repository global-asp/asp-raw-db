P1	Once apon a time there were two best friends . The   baboon and the tortise they lived in the jungle.
P2	One day the baboon called a few friends to his house for a party.
P3	He also invited tortise . But then he also said.
P4	"Tortoise I invite you to my party at my house it starts at  sunset ..blah.blah....... just come okay".
P5	And then tortoise agreed and then there it reached sunset .
P6	Tortoise was getting ready for the party . Then the baboon thought  " Let me set it on the tree".
P7	When the tortise arrived he saw that the party was set on the tree."Baboon please set the party done here".
P8	"Tortoise  my friend I don't want to"said the baboon. and then the tortise replied"At least throw something for me to eat".
P9	But then baboon said"If you want to eat climb ". Tortoise said " you know l can't climb".
P10	"It's your problem"and continued eating.And then the tortise went away.
P11	A few days later the baboon was hungry and went to tortoise's house .
P12	"Tortise please may I  have some food " said the baboon . "Baboon go wash  your hands".
P13	And the river was a few feet away then baboon washed and went to back "go wash them again"said tortoise.
P14	This time baboon tried and used his hands again." Tortoise I can't do it" " next time you must not do it again" said tortoise.
P15	And gave him a bowl to wash his hands @                     The end@                      By: Jonathan Mushonga gr6
