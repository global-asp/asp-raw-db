P1	When Elephant ruled@@    Â© Marvin Omondi 2022@          African storybook
P2	Long long time ago when the lion was not the king of the jungle,in the savanna grasslands the mighty elephant ruled.
P3	The elephant was given the position by tortoise the wise . Tortoise was a messenger of god and had power to elect a leader.
P4	God of the animals had forbidden everyone from eating meat,all the animals ate grass. Every morning the leader of the animals was required to sing a song before every meal.
P5	" All animals eat grass, no animal eat meat, cats and  non cats" That was the song.@It happened that during the sunny period. Mr Buffalo,the step brother to the elephant had harvested honey.
P6	Mr. Buffalo had made honey beer,when Elephant came over to his house,he drank alot of beer.@@In the morning,he was still drunk and he did not sing the song well.
P7	"cats ..ea ..t..eat meat...animals eat grass.. elephant stammered. When the messenge reached god,god answered it by making all the cats to eat meat,the lion, leopard, cheetah and the panther.
P8	The lion being the eldest in the cat family, became the leader.@@Until today the lion still roars as he rules the savanna grasslands.
