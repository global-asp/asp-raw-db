P1	Once upon a time, in the small village of Machoka there lived an old man called Butere.Butere lived in a traditional house known as manyatta.He stayed always in this house because he was too old to walk.
P2	Whenever Butere went in his bed to sleep during the night he could be disturbed by squeaks sound .This old man could not sleep comfortably in peace and never enjoyed his sleep.
P3	One day ,Butere felt he could not tolerate anymore ."I must know where these sounds  come from ",Butere said to himself in his old shaking voice.
P4	Butere woke up that morning , supporting himself with his stick.He looked at his old blanket and noticed some holes."ooh,this silly animal must be a rat!"The old Butere said angrily.I must teach this stupid animal a lesson today!".
P5	Butere proceeded to his store of his food and found that the rat had destroyed his cereals and maize."Shame on you",the old Butere shouted angrily as if he was addressing anyone.That night Butere took  a piece of ugali and poisoned it.
P6	As usual Butere went to sleep.He heard the chirps sounds ,before even he could fall asleep."it is the end of it today!"Butere whispered to himself.After a short while ,he heard a hissing sound."it must be dying now!"the old man thought.
P7	Butere slowly walked to where the trap was and found the rat dying helplessly "here you are",Butere shouted.He angrily bit the rat until it died.Since that day Butere was never disturbed again.He slept peacefully there after
