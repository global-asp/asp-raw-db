page_text:

P1	Tamara was a five-year-old girl who lived with her family. 

Their village was near a forest that had wild animals.
P2	Tamara was obedient to her parents. 

She looked after sheep and goats.
P3	Tamara loved listening to birds singing as she took care of the animals. 

As the birds sang, she put her own words to the tune.
P4	Tamara was too young for school. Her parents only allowed their older children, Nashipae and Tasieku, to go to school. It was 10 kilometres away.
P5	Nashipae and Tasieku went with other children from the village in the morning and returned in the evening. 

They carried food in small containers
P6	Tamara asked her mother, "When will I go to school?" 

Her mother answered, "You go soon, my dear child."
P7	One day, a car arrived with the chief and two ladies. 

The chief made sure that children went to school at the right age.
P8	People believed that if a child was able to stretch her hand over her head and touch the ear, she was ready to start school.
P9	The chief asked, "How old are you?" Tamara replied, "I am five years old." 

"Let's see if you can go to school," the chief said.
P10	One of the ladies took Tamara's right arm and gently placed it over her head. 

Tamara touched her left ear.
P11	Tamara would go to a different school than Nashipae and Tasieku. 

It was new and closer to home.
P12	Tamara was very happy. 

She thought, "I will read and write like Nashipae and Tasieku."
