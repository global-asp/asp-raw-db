page_text:

P1	“The day has finally arrived! I can’t believe it, I am officially a teenager. I suddenly feel a little taller. Mom, dad make way for your teenaged daughter!”
P2	I walked through the house, and to my surprise, no one was there! I heard laughter and cheering in the distance and immediately thought. “It must be for me, the birthday girl.”
P3	Sadly, my family said absolutely nothing. The boys continued to play soccer, and mom and dad greeted me like they do every other day.
P4	My heart sank and my eyes began to fill with tears. The boys rushed to my side and asked, “What’s wrong?” l shrugged my shoulders, walked away and wondered “Why would they ask, surely they know it’s my big big day.”
P5	I made my way to my best friend, because I knew that Lebo would never forget my birthday. But she too, had nothing to say about my special day. I ran to our special tree and made my way up to the top.
P6	From the bottom of the tree, mom and dad yelled “Thandi, come down from the tree, we have something to show you!” I made my way down from the tree and walked back home with mom and dad.
P7	When I made my way to the gate, all I could hear were the loud screams of everyone saying “SURPRISE!!” Mom stood by my side and whispered in my ear “Surely you didn’t think we would forget your big big day.”
P8	I was speechless. I smiled from ear to ear and couldn’t believe that everyone pulled off this big surprise.
