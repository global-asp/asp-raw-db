desc:	This story is about my son Lethabo and how giving he is. I had to teach him the importance of sharing. We need to teach our kids from a little age to grow up and become the best they could be.

page_text:

P1	Growing up being raised by a super hero mom.@@My mother dedicates her life making sure i get to grow without having to worry about a thing.@@She baths me, feeds me and read bed time stories for me.
P2	I call her a super hero mom because she makes things happen for me.@She plays with me anytime of the day. @She makes time for me even when she is busy.
P3	My mom has love in her heart big enough to raise the whole village.@She cares so much for my friends and other children.@She always reminds me how important it is to share the little i have with others. @She stresses alot about giving.
P4	Sometimes i would hide my biscuits and she would tell me they will rot and be a waste. "it is better when you share Thabo, other kids are not as fortunate as you are" She say's.
P5	There and then i remember that we need to share and look out for each other to survive.@There are so many things that we can share, such as love, humanity, peace and clothes even. @When you do not need something, give it to someone else.
P6	When helping others do not go gossipping about how you have helped them, that is not humanity. @I have learnt from my mom to respect my peers and elders because from disrespecting others you do not gain anything.
P7	Take good care of yourself and others, love your mother and others just like i love my mom and my sister Hlompho.
