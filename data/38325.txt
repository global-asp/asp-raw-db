page_text:

P1	I think school food should change because lots of kids go home sick because of how bad the school lunches can be. I am not saying that the lunch ladies and men don't do a good job, but they are not so good.
P2	School's should be able to have different stands with different foods so that kids could be able to pick what they want to eat. Some kids pack lunches but not all kids have money to afford packing lunches.
P3	It is also not so good to let kids pick what lunches the school should supply. If kids did do that then the whole school will be eating unhealthy.
P4	To confirm this, it is good for kids to have different stands for different foods so that not everyone has to get the same thing that someone else gets. It is healthy for kids to get different foods every day to grow strong and healthy!
