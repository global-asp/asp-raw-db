desc:	Rabbit invites his friend Monkey over to play

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  Rabbit and Monkey were friends. One day,  in a time of famine,  Rabbit invited Monkey over to play.
P2	Rabbit said,  "Let's play cooking each other!" Monkey asked,  "How can we do that?"
P3	Rabbit answered,  "First,  we have to make a fire."
P4	Rabbit continued,  "We fill a pot with water,  and then put it on the fire."
P5	"I will get in first. When I beat on the lid of the pot,  you open it. Then I will get out." Rabbit explained. Monkey agreed.
P6	So,  Rabbit got in the pot first.
P7	When the water started to warm up,  Rabbit knocked,  and Monkey opened the lid.
P8	When it was Monkey's turn,  Rabbit put a big stone on the lid of the pot and sat on top of it as well!
P9	When the water started to boil,  Monkey knocked,  but Rabbit didn't open the lid.
P10	Monkey died,  and Rabbit ate his best friend!
