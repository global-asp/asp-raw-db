page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in a place called South Africa. There were husbands who would spend most days in taverns drinking and their wives would be home looking after the kids, cooking and cleaning.  Drunken husbands  would return home and ask their wives if they had cooked and if she didn´t, she would get a beating from her husband.
P2	Husbands hitting their wives. Sadly most women are being abused daily. Men being abused is rarely talked about in our homes or communities.
P3	One woman out of many woman in South Africa ,didnt take her drunk husband coming home lightly, whenever he came home drunk she would refuse to give him food and didn´t allow him to sleep in their bed. One cold night she told her husband to sleep on the floor without a blanket, which he did.
P4	Sore and cold the man got up the next morning, he was tired of the abuse from his wife. He decided to take money from their savings and bought a gun, he had promised himself that he was going to kill his wife if she ever laid a finger on him again.
P5	As per normal the man went about his  business, when his nagging wife enters through their front door. They exchanged a few hateful words with one another. The husband then tells his wife that he would be leaving, he wants a divorce.
P6	An enraged wife could not believe what she had just heard, she immediately lays hands on her husband, kicking and screaming at him, telling him that he would never leave her and she continues beating him up. He then reaches for the gun he bought gives her one look and fires the gun at his wife.
P7	There is blood everywhere, the kids are crying, the mothers lifeless body down on the cold floor. The father still in a daze reaches for his cellphone and calls for an ambulance.
P8	The wife was then admitted to the hospital and treated for her injury. The doctors informed the children that she will be fine.
P9	The husband, feeling guilty, decides to hand himself over to the police. He regrets his actions and more so for doing what he had done in front of their children.
P10	The husband learns a very important lesson : violence is never the answer. He is sentenced to eighteen months of community service and spends his time teaching others about the importance of anger management.
