page_text:

P1	Kopano and Lereko are eating scones that they baked with their mother.@@Those scones are covered with honey!
P2	"Ma, where does honey come from?" asks Lereko.@@"It is so sweet, is it made from sugar?" guesses Kopano.
P3	"No, it's not from sugar. Bees make honey," answers mother.
P4	"They collect nectar from flowers, and store it in their hives. The nectar slowly changes to honey," explains mother.
P5	"Bees must visit hundreds of flowers to make a bottle of honey!" says Kopano with admiration.@@Lereko nods his head and whistles.
P6	"Bees also make propolis, which is used in some medicines," continues mother.@@"Prop what? Prop-olis? What is that?" asks Lereko.
P7	"It is a sticky mix produced by bees," replies mother.@@"Propolis is used in some medicines to treat skin problems, colds and coughs."
P8	"You two should find out more about bees and how they help us," smiles mother.@@Kopano and Lereko had a new respect for bees!
