page_text:

P1	There were two men who lived with their families in a certain village.
P2	The huts in the village were scattered over a large area.
P3	Livestock keeping was their main source of livelihood. They kept a lot of animals.
P4	During those days,  there was a severe drought. Plants dried up.
P5	Famine was severe. People thought of when they and their animals were healthy.
P6	One day,  two men went hunting. As they hunted,  they saw a giraffe eating leaves and twigs on a tall tree.
P7	They whispered to each other on how they would kill it and enjoy the meat.
P8	One said,  "I will spear it!" Just as he stretched his hand with a spear to kill,  the other hunter held his hand back.
P9	The hunter got disappointed and left. The one who stopped the other decided to climb up the tree which the giraffe was feeding on. He jumped onto the giraffe's neck and held it firm.
P10	The giraffe was scared. He ran through the forest rubbing himself on bushes.
P11	The hunter was tired and injured. He fell off the giraffe's neck. His body was covered in blood.
P12	He was helped by a passer-by who took him to his home and treated.
P13	At home,  the hunter narrated how the giraffe hunt got him in trouble. From that day,  he swore never to hunt wild animals again.
