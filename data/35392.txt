desc:	Zadoo wants to visit the places and people in African Storybook stories. Who would she see

page_text:

P1	My name is Zadoo. I love reading storybooks.@@If I could visit an African Storybook storybook,
P2	I would visit 'A Very Tall Man' in his very tall house in the forest.@@I would sit on his very tall chair and eat with his very long fork.
P3	I would visit 'The Magical Rainbow River' in Mbadede, to eat the ice cream found on the river banks. @@I may even take a drink for healing.
P4	I would visit 'Kalabushe the Talkative', and ask her to please share the recipe for her grandmother's pie. @@I like learning new recipes.
P5	I would visit 'Abebech the Bajaj Driver' in Ethiopia.@@She is such an inspiration! @@Read her story to find out why she is inspiring.
P6	I would follow the 'Busy, Busy Sun' to Terfa's compound for the recipe of  bier and apukpa. @@I hear it is some kind of millet porridge and bambara nut pudding.
P7	I would join Juma and Kadogo in the 'Africa Unity Race', a marathon to unite all African people.@@Maybe they would let me hold the torch of flames as we run together.
P8	I would spend some time with Ayator and his friends, to learn more about how 'Emotions Come and Go'.@@How are you feeling right now?
P9	I would join Hamisi and his father to shop for a new uniform in 'Hamisi's Lucky Day'. @@I like admiring new and colourful clothes at the market, and finding out prices.
P10	In 'Kariza's Questions', I would join Kariza at school to also ask her teacher some questions. @@I would use a microscope to see the germs on my hands. I would wash the germs away with soap and water!
P11	I would visit Anansi the clever spider. I want to say "thank you" to him.@@He did a splendid job at getting stories from the sky god Nyame, and bringing them to earth.@@Do you know 'How Stories Came to People'?
P12	In this storybook, I took you to visit the characters and places in some of my favourite storybooks. @@When you next read a storybook, where will you visit and who will you meet?
