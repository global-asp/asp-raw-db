page_text:

P1	Sheep lived in the city. She got tired of city life and decided to go to the bush.
 
On her way she met Hyena who had not eaten for many days.
P2	She greeted Hyena over and over again, "Brother Hyena, how are you? Brother Hyena, how are you?"
 
Hyena answered Sheep, "Don't greet me over and over. Do something to end my hunger."
P3	When Sheep heard this, she started running. 

Suddenly, she reached Lion's den. Hyena was running after her. 

Hyena arrived at the den and finally stopped, throwing dust into Lion's eyes.
P4	Lion said to Hyena, "Can't we even find peace in our dens? You throw dust into our eyes!" 

Hyena answered, "King, I did not mean to disrespect you! I am only running after my food!"
P5	Lion said, "You are food to me, too, Hyena. Did I chase you? You came to me. Don't blame me later."
P6	Then Lion said to Sheep, "Why did you come to the bush?" 

Sheep replied, "I came because I am a diviner."
P7	Lion said, "Prepare traditional medicine to prove that you are truly a diviner." Sheep replied, "My medicine is expensive." 

Lion said, "That is no problem, whatever it costs. There is nothing that is impossible for me."
P8	Sheep said, "The medicine is Hyena's ear." 

Lion cut off Hyena's ear and gave it to Sheep. 

Sheep put Hyena's ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
P9	Lion ate Hyena's ear and found it so sweet. 

He asked Sheep, "Is it possible for me to 
have the second ear?"
P10	Sheep said, "Yes, it is possible my king." So Lion cut off Hyena's second ear and brought it to Sheep. 

Sheep put the ear inside a jar of honey and gave it to Lion.
P11	Then Lion said to Sheep, "Is it possible to get the skin?" Sheep replied, "I think it is possible my king." 

When Hyena heard this he was afraid of dying, and ran. Lion ran after him.
P12	"If such is life in the bush, then it is better for me to return home," said Sheep.
