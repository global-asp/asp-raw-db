page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, the was a little girl who saw a secret gate , everyday she used to wonder what was life like past the secret gate.So one day she decided to enter those gates, and no sooner than she did she walked into this beautiful land.
P2	No one had known about where she had gone but the place wasn't like a normal place, little fairies fluttering about. Tiny people with hearts made of pure gold. And little flowers that would light up everytime the little girl sang
P3	And the song she sang was quite unusual,@"Everytime I look at u , I would be confused but thought to myself what a wonderful world, if the trees talk, if the breeze could walk, I'd look at you . Because I know that u were made for me"
P4	And that's how the girl was known as the most important person to nature, and that's why this short story was written by me a twelve year girl who loves nature and using her imagination.
