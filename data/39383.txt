page_text:

P1	Welcome to Vitani Village. All monkeys live in harmony together with human beings.
P2	One day, the Gorilla Chief called all monkeys to a crucial meeting.
P3	"It seems like the humans have forgotten that we own part of their banana plantations!" Said the Gorilla Chief in an alarming voice. "We have to show them that they need to let us into their shambas! We will go to war!"
P4	All the monkeys jumped up and down. Others swang on trees making loud noises. They all went to raid the shambas belonging to the neighbouring humans. "We want our parts!" Shouted the monkeys while they continued raiding.
P5	Humans ran here and there trying to scare away the monkeys.
P6	When they had enough of the monkeys' raid, their chief took a loudspeaker and spoke, "Dear monkeys, tell your Gorilla Chief that we have accepted to share our banana plantations with you. Please stop the raid."
P7	On hearing this, all monkeys celebrated as they went to tell their chief the good news.
P8	From that day, monkeys lived in harmony with human beings. The Angry Gorilla Chief made a loud roar to show that he had accepted the offer and they would never raid the banana plantations again.
