P1	There once was a girl by the name of Thembi, she lived with mother in a small village. They were very poor and hardly had any food to eat everyday. This made her mother very sad. Every night before bed, her mother would kneel down and pray, asking GOD to create a better and successful life for her daughter.
P2	Thembi is at school. She loves learning new things.  She likes, reading books and helping others. When Thembi grows up, she would like to become a Doctor.
P3	Everyday Thembi walks to school and her mother is out looking for a job. After walking around for hours hungry and thirsty her mom meets an old man, in need of a domestic worker.
P4	Thembi's mom speaks to the old man, telling him how she needs a job and he needs the help. With a big smile on the old mans face he offers her the job.
P5	She couldn't wait for Thembi to get home, so she can tell her the great news that she found a job today and they don't have to worry about food anymore.
P6	Thembi's mom woke up early the next morning and off they went, Thembi went to school and her mom went to work. She did the man's washing, washed the dishes, ironed his clothes and scrubbed the floors. The old man was impressed by all the work she managed to do in one day. He then paid her and she went home very happy.
P7	She used her money very wisely, she bought food and a few seeds which she planted as soon as she got home. A few months had passed and before they knew there were some fruit and vegetables growing in their own back yard. Thembi's mom would sell the fruit and vegetables and all the money she had made she would bank so that Thembelihle could go to varsity one day.
P8	Finally the day arrived for Thembi to start varsity which she did, Thembi went on and became a successful doctor and she made tons of money. Thembi opened a spaza shop for her mom where she sold more than fruit and vegetables. They also made regular donations to orphanages.
P9	Thembi was so greatful to GOD for all that HE has done for them that she wrote a song in adoration to GOD.@@THE SONG: Thank you heavenly father, I'm eternally greatful for all your blessings, YOU haven't failed me yet, OH LORD you're faithful, OH LORD you're faithful, YOU haven't failed me yet!!
