page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there were twin brothers. Their names were Kuluyolo and Azomila. The twin brothers lived with their father in a village. Kuluyolo and Azomila loved each other so much and did everything together.
P2	One day, their father picked some fruit from a tree in the yard. The tree had delicious fruit.@@ The twins would take some fruit to sell in the market to help their father on Sundays. They loved helping their father sell in the market.
P3	The next morning, the twins woke up early to go to the market. They told each other stories and jokes on the way to the market. As they were on their way, Azomila heard a sound from a bush nearby.
P4	They could not see what was making the sound but they were very scared. The twins decided to walk faster but the sound in the bush became louder and louder. Then suddenly, a big monkey jumped in front of them.
P5	The twins dropped the basket with the fruit and moved back as they were afraid of the monkey.
P6	The monkey walked towards the twins and started eating the delicious fruit they were going to sell in the market. They started to cry as they had to explain to their father why they didn't sell any fruit.
P7	Kuluyolo and Azomila ran home to their father crying. They told their father what happened and he was very cross. He told them to go and pick more fruit to sell in the market. Kuluyolo and Azomila went into the yard to pick the fruit.
P8	As they were picking the fruit, Kuluyolo thought of a plan to stop the monkey from stealing their fruit. They carried another basket with fruit and a surprise for the monkey. As they walked to the market, they saw the monkey again.
P9	"This will sure teach the moneky a lesson.", said Azomila. The monkey grabbed the basket from the twins. As soon as the monkey put the basket on the floor, a dog jumped out and chased the monkey away.
P10	The twins continued walking to the market to sell the fruit. The monkey ran and was never seen again. The twins came back with an empty basket and money to give to their father. They all lived happily without the monkey.
