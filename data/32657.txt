page_text:

P1	There was a famine in the land of Jato-akaa so the monkeys had a meeting to figure out how to get food for everyone.
P2	Anbagu volunteered to travel to mzembe the land where it was rumored that there was prosperity and plenty to eat.
P3	He climbed over a mountain but slipped and fell. He got up and continued climbing till he got to safety.
P4	As he crossed over, he heard the sound of water, when he looked closely he saw yummy looking fruits on a tree. He ran towards it.
P5	He jumped to pluck the fruits but slipped and fell so he had to climb the tree to get the fruits.
P6	On the tree, he decided to eat some of the fruits. He was so full that he slept off. He woke up and was worried that his friends would still be hungry.
P7	He hurriedly plucked some for his friends and started on his journey back to Jato-akaa. He struggled up the mountain with the fruits but finally made it.
P8	When he arrived at Jato-akaa, all the monkeys cheered, although some were too hungry to cheer but they were excited to see some food at last!
