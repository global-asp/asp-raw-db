page_text:

P1	A long time ago in the most luxurious forest in the world. Lived a very happy group of dinosaurs. Especially a very happy little family of dinosaurs who are welcoming their newest member of the family. A baby dinosaur named Flood.
P2	Flood was a very energetic and happy to be in the world. His parents were very excited to have him there, it made them happy too.
P3	As Flood grew up he became very mischievous and no longer liked to listen to his parents. They knew that this would happen but they did not think anything bad of it until he started lying to them.
P4	Floods mother told him that he need to stop the lying otherwise bad things will happen. She tried to be stern but did not want to make him scared or act out worse than he already was.
P5	Flood did not listen to his mom. He thought that this was just something she was trying to make him listen to her and behave.
P6	That night a rain storm came. All the rain started to overflow the pond that they had in their backyard.
P7	Flood wondered why there was so much rain the night before. Ultimately Flood did not care and continued to be a naughty dinosaur.
P8	Floods dad told him when he got home that he better make sure that he closes his windows because there is going to be another bad storm that night.
P9	Flood did not care about what his dad told him and instead went into the basement and watched TV until bed time.
P10	That night the rain poured, and poured. It didnt let up.
P11	The rain kept coming until you couldnt see anymore grass or plants just land.
P12	Soon the water continued to rise. Everything was starting to sucum to the high water levels.
P13	In one day the entire land was completely flooded over no more trees, plants, flowers, not even any dinosaurs left.
