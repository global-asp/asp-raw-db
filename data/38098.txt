page_text:

P1	Akhona was an 8-year old tiny little girl who was doing grade 2 at the Apple Primary School in the township of Langa in Cape Town.
P2	One day her teacher Mrs. Mooi told them to make a picture of the rainbow using paints. Akhona was very excited to do this activty as she loved doing art and was good at it.
P3	She was good in everything that involved art at school. Akhona always worked with her friend by the name Lizzy. Lizzy was in the same class as Akhona and was a vey humble little girl.
P4	Akhona and Lizzy always supported each other in whatever they at school and outside school. Other children from Akbona's class wers jelous of Akhona.
P5	They always told Akhona that she was forward and wanted to impress their teacher at all times. They carried on telling her that she wanted to be the only one who got credit from Mrs. Mooi.
P6	She kept on telling them that they can also work hard and take pride in their school work. Unfortunately, the learners were not interested to hear what she told them. They were only aiming at pulling her down in whatever she did.
P7	All the learners went outside to hang their pictures to get dry. After sometime, they went to fetch their pictures of the rainbow from outside. Surprisingly everyone had their pictures except for Akhona. Her picture was nowhere to be found.
P8	"Who might have taken my picture?" Thought Akhona. She looked around the school playground i  case it was blown away by the wind. Akhona got tired of lookind as she could not find her picture.
P9	"I cannot find my picture anywhere." Akhona told her teacher. She was teary. Lizzy was next to her. ""We will find it my friend." Said Lizzy as she hugged her friend. "Is there anyone in class who has seen Akhona's picture?" Asked Mrs. Mooi
P10	After school on that day Lizzy was asked by Mrs. Mooi to empty the class rubbish bin. While she was throwing the rubbish, she noticed a paper with a beautiful picture of the rainbow. Lizzy took the picture to the teacher.
P11	The next day told the class a picture of the rainbow with Akhona's name was found in the school rubbish bin. "Who took Akhona's picture and threw it in the rubbish bin?" Asked Mrs. Mooi. All the learners kept quiet and did not answer.
