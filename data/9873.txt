page_text:

P1	I live in a small village called Awe. This village is 10km from the District headquarters. Our nearest clinic called hope centre clinic. There are two main tribes including: The Acholis. The people in our village live happily. The main activities in our village are,  farming,  fishing,  brick making and trading. People depend on these activities to get money for themselves. With this money they are able to build good,  permanent houses for themselves pay school fees for their children.
P2	However brick making has been misused in some ways. The young generation,  especially the boys,  have left schools at an early age to do the hardworking in brick making. The government,  however,  is trying to find ways to helping my village my village by encouraging children to go and stay in school.
