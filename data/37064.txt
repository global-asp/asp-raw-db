page_text:

P1	My name is Nothando. This story is about my friends. Mvelo and Omaatla. We do a lot of things together, we play and dance. After school we wash the dishes and our school uniforms before we go to play.
P2	One afternoon we saw an accident when we were going to the park, people were screaming for help and we were so scared. An ambulance came and they took the people to the hospital. I didn't sleep that night, I was so scared.
P3	I love to swim, one day we went to the beach at Durban with my mother. I saw the beautiful sea for the first time. I made sand castles. We enjoyed our weekend away. My favourite sport is swimming. Mvelo and Omaatla also love swimming.
P4	At School they always teach us to respect our parents and teachers. They also teach us to share our food with other children who don't have food. We practice social distancing and wash our hands before we eat or we use spoon to eat.
P5	One day at creche I hurt myself. We were playing with my friends and I bumped myself on the window. I was left bleeding and with a scar. My mother took me to the doctor and I got stiches on my forehead. We must be very careful when we play.
P6	My mother is the most beautiful woman. She prays for us before we wake up, when we eat and when we go to bed. She loves reading bible stories to me. My friends and I go to church on weekends. God is Love, my favourite story is about Moses.
P7	My friends help me with homework. My favourite subject is Maths and I always do that alone. Mvelo loves English language. She reads books to us most of the times. She is older than myself and Omaatla.
P8	I hate children who are bullies. In grade 1, there were two girls who always took my food and I will not have food to eat during break time. One day I told my teacher, and the two kids got a punishment to pick up the papers in the school.
P9	One day we went to the mall and we saw a man on a wheelchair, Mvelo told us that no one must laugh at him. She said so because we are all fearfully and wonderfully made by God. No one must laugh at someone who cannot walk or see.
