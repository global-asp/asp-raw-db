page_text:

P1	Kwesi Gyasi lived with his parents in a village called Asempaye. He had a very good friend called Kweku Twum. They lived in the same village, and went to the same school. 

Kwesi's parents were Papa and Maame. Maame always advised her son, "Don't swim in any river or sea because it is dangerous."
P2	During the school vacation, Kweku Twum travelled to Simpa (Winneba). He went to spend the holiday with his uncle, Kobina Amfo who was a very good fisherman. Kobina Amfo had many canoes at Simpa.
P3	When Kweku Twum returned from Simpa, he visited his friend Kwesi Gyasi. He told Kwesi about his experiences and enjoyment, especially swimming in the sea! 

Kwesi was interested and wished he had travelled with Kweku to the sea.
P4	One afternoon, the two friends decided to swim in the village stream. They went out when nobody was watching.

As soon as they got to the stream, Kweku Twum jumped into the water with a splash. He called Kwesi Gyasi to join him but he did not. He remembered his mother's advice.
P5	But Kweku finally convinced his friend to swim. They really enjoyed themselves in the water. 

It was getting late and the sun was setting. Kweku told Kwesi to get ready to go home. He got out of the water, dried himself and put on his clothes. Kwesi was still in the water.
P6	At last Kwesi decided to get out of the water. But he felt something pull his leg, and then a terrible pain. "What is the matter?" he cried. 

He turned, looked down into the water, and screamed. He saw a crocodile, the god of the stream! He started shouting for help.
P7	Kweku Twum heard his friend shouting. He went to help Kwesi. 

Kweku pulled his friend onto dry land and then rushed to the village to get help.

The villagers heard Kweku shouting and ran towards the stream. They found Kwesi Gyasi lying unconscious, with blood on the ground. They carried the boy to the clinic.
P8	The next day, Kwesi woke up in a hospital bed with his parents and Kweku Twum standing beside him. He had a sharp pain in his left leg. 

They told him that his left leg was cut. Kwesi started crying and begged his mother to forgive him. She replied quietly, "As the saying goes, 'Had I known is always last.' If only you had listened."
