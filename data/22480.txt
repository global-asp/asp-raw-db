P1	This is Nafuraki and Jumanne with their Baba, Ijumma. They are twins and live in Kakamega, Kenya. They go to a boarding school in Nairobi, Kenya's largest city.
P2	They enjoy living there along with their friends. Math and science are their favorite subjects. Some of their lessons are taught outdoors.  Kenya is a coastal country near the Atlantic Ocean and sits on the Equator. The climate is mild, a good part of the year.
P3	Soon, they will be leaving for Holiday. All of the schools, most businesses, and government buildings will be closed to celebrate Independence Day.
P4	When alone with Nafuraki, Jumanne will sometimes talk about not living at home to help their parents with all the work that needs to be done. She also misses her baby brother and sister, who are twins too.
P5	Nafuraki cheers her up by reminding her of what their Baba would say, "Hakuna Matata, Jumanne! School is where we want you to be."
P6	Happy to get out of their uniforms, they pack their bags and say goodbye to their friends. They soon fall asleep during the long bus ride home.
P7	Nafuraki and Jumanne are happy to be back home. 
Jambo Mama, Jumanne says, as her mother kiss her on both cheeks. (Jambo means hello)
  Jambo Baba, Nafuraki yells at his father, as Baba grabbed his wrists in greeting. Grandma Maliki is so  happy to see them and the twins are happy to see her also.
P8	The families decorate their homes with balloons, flowers and large green leaves growing from the palm trees. They purchase food at the market. When it is time, they will dress in their traditional dresses, skirts, scarves or hats, colorful robes and jewelry.
P9	Jumanne looks around at her parents, her brothers and sisters, her grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. She smiles as she thinks to herself, "what a big family we are!"
P10	The music and singing begins to swell, and they all began to dance to its happy beat. The celebrating is beginning! Tonight is for family and the joy of coming together again.
P11	Nafuraki and Jumanne listen as their Baba, who is the world's greatest storyteller, tells their favorite Tinga Tinga tales to the group. Some are sitting, others standing, or laying down on the soft tall grass.
 Why coyote howls at the moon, how zebra found his stripes, or why elephant has a long trunk are some of their favorite stories.
P12	The enjoy eating Nyama Choma (roasted goat or beef) served with beans, rice or yams, maize (corn), and fresh mangoes and other fruits. At  the end of a long day, the twins fall asleep and dream of a happy tomorrow.
P13	They are playing soccer with their cousins,
P14	or swimming  in the river,
P15	or going fishing with their Baba and other family members.
P16	Best of all, they dream of helping out at home and being part of the family. They come together to help each another. Jumanne is 10 years old and ready to learn about basket making, knitting, cooking, and beaded jewelry.
P17	Kenyatta Day is finally here. It is named after Kenya's first President, Jamo Kenyatta. It is also called  Masujaa Day, which means "heroes" in Swahili. It is the native language for most of the people of Kenya.
It is a time of Harambee, of pulling together the families and pulling together the nation.
P18	They watched the colorful military  troops march in the parade, wearing uniforms of red, green and white.  They wear the colors of the national flag. The people listen to the poems and speeches, remembering  their past struggle for independence from the British colonies.
P19	They listened to Mama Ngina's church choir sing. The women in their white shirts and and blue skirts with bare feet and the men in blue pants, white shirts and ties. many had bare feet too.
P20	Nafuraki and Jumanne talked about everything they had seen and done, before going to sleep. Tomorrow, Nafuraki's Baba will teach them pottery-making and how to sell to the visitors who come to market, from the cities and other countries.
P21	Soon, their holiday will be over and time for Nafuraki and Jumanne to go back to school.  It is always hard to leave, but they know they will return for the week of Kwanzaa (Christmas)  and stay until the New Year begins.
