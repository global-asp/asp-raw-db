page_text:

P1	I use my feet to run,  jump,  and kick.
P2	I use my hands to eat,  work,  and hug.
P3	But the head is more important than feet or hands.
P4	The head has the eyes. I see with my eyes.
P5	The head has the nose. I smell with my nose.
P6	The head has the ears. I hear with my ears.
P7	The head has the tongue. I taste salty and sweet.
P8	The head has the mouth. I speak with myÂ mouth.
P9	The head controls the whole body!
