P2	We were doing our final exam (KCPE) and everyone had worked very hard for it.I had spent all my time reading.My classmates nicknamed me" bookworm" Everyone had a target and a dream  to join a National school.
P3	The teacher brought in the exams and we answered the questions according to our knowledge.We all finished in two hours and submitted our answer sheets.The teacher instructed us to go home and wait for the results.
P4	After two weeks,my parents were called and I was told to go to school and pick my results.As I made my way to school I was both happy and nervous.
