page_text:

P1	"Where are we going?" asked Usha. "To meet the lemurs!" replied Meera and Devyani, with excitement.
P2	"Where are they?" she asked. But only the lemurs could answer that. So the journey continued.
P3	"Look!" exclaimed Rukmini. And there they were. Two little lazy lemurs. Napping after their afternoon snack. What a delight!
P4	But one of them woke up. And looked straight at Devyani. In her mind, he said, "Go away, I'm sleeping!" And we were on our way.
