page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, in the village of Munderime, there lived a poor young girl called Irene. She had no parents. Irene could not live alone and therefore, she lived with her friends who kept a smile in her face.
P2	She desired to live with her parents like other children but it was impossible. Irene tried to make new friends in the nearby school but they all run from her because she did not bath regularly.
P3	One day as she was walking along the road, she saw some dirty clothes.Joyfully, she took them and went to a nearby river to wash them at least to increase hers. One by one she spread them on the riverside to dry as she took a bath.
P4	Two children came to fetch water but when they saw Irene they run away. Irene felt bad why children avoided her. Her sight put them off. She did not know what to do. After she was done with taking her bath, she wore her clothes and left.
P5	On her way back to the street, a man grabbed her to a car and drove away. After a while Irene found herself in a weird place. The man tied her legs with a rope. He later came holding a knife and placed it on her neck.
P6	Suddenly the man received a call and placed the knife on the table and walked out to pick the call. Irene took advantage of the man's absence and cut the rope using the knife which was placed on the nearby table and ran away.
P7	After the man was done with his call, he found out that Irene was missing. Hurriedly, he went out to look for her. By that time, Irene had ran as fast as she could. Luckily she met a policeman on patrol and narrated the whole story.
P8	The investigation was done to find out who the culpit was. They tracked him and he was arrested. Irene was taken to a children's home. From that day Irene lived a happy life there after.
