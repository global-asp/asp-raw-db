P1	THE BIKE  RIDE    My  dad is asleep."Wake up" I said. "It's time for our bike ride"
P2	His feet were out of the blanket. "OK I'll wake up," said dad. So he did.
P3	His feet were stretching on his bike. I was in the basket. I was too small for the basket.
P4	Now l'm big enough for the basket. He starts to cycle. The end
