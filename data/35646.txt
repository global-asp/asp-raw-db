page_text:

P1	I live in a house in Ndorong,  in Kaolack, close to the big mosque.
P2	The house isn't very far from my school.
P3	You can recognise it by its lovely brown and white tiles and its large grey metal door.
P4	Inside the tiled wall, there is a big yard and a mango tree.
P5	In the house there are five bedrooms and a kitchen. There is also a small yard for the sheep.
P6	My family eat dinner together under the mango tree.
P7	At night, all the family watch the television together.
P8	I really like my house because I never feel alone there.
