page_text:

P1	A long time ago, there was village called Tuntunganga. The people of Tuntunganga were farmers. @@In a certain year, before the maize were ripe for harvest, troops of monkeys invaded the farms.
P2	Efforts by the villagers to ward off the animals failed. The king called the elders for a meeting. @@He announced that anyone who could save the village from famine could marry, Pheetami, the princess.
P3	The town crier was sent out to announce the decision to the villagers. @@Many men began thinking of ways of catching the clever monkeys. But none could catch a single monkey. @@The troop caused more havoc.
P4	Young men spent entire days chasing the monkeys. They wanted to marry the princess. @@Pheelamilo only spread his mat under a tree and relaxed.
P5	In the evening, Pheelamilo would go to the stream to swim. @@He noticed that the monkeys always returned to the forest after destroying the farms. @@Meanwhile, the king was getting more worried.
P6	On the third day, Pheelamilo woke up very early and went to the stream. He observed the monkeys. @@He discovered that they drank water before crossing to destroy the maize. They drank again before retiring to the forest.
P7	The chief monkey arrived first. He drank water, ate maize and then climbed up a tree. @@The other monkeys went to the farms. The chief alerted the others if someone approached. They would all flee. He would leave last.
P8	People were becoming more worried. @@"I will give a herd of cattle also, to whoever will drive away these monkeys," the king promised.
P9	In the morning, Pheelamilo hid near the stream. The chief monkey sat in a tree as usual and watched out for the troop. @@Pheelamilo waited patiently until the troop left. He then scattered roast groundnuts near the stream.
P10	The next time the chief monkey came down to drink, he started eating the groundnuts. @@He picked them until he reached a small hole with more nuts. As he reached into the hole, a rope seized his hand. @@Pheelamilo took the chief monkey home.
P11	Pheelamilo tied up the chief monkey and shaved off his fur. @@The villagers did not know why he shaved the monkey, and they laughed at him.
P12	As the troops were causing havoc, Pheelamilo released their chief. @@He ran to join his troops, but they fled! As he ran towards the other monkeys, they fled from him. @@The king happily fulfilled his promises. Pheetami and Pheelamilo married, with many cattle.
