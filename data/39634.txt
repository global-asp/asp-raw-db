page_text:

P1	There lived a snake and a monkey in a forest. The snake was selfish, wheras the monkey was loyal. But the monkey teased an ape.
P2	One day the snake accidentally fell into a trap set by a farmer who wanted to trap antelopes that ate his crops. It tried to set itself free, but it couldn't. Therefore, it waited for another animal to save it. The monkey was seeking it.
P3	On its way, the monkey saw the snake trapped. The monkey asked who did that. The snake told the monkey that it was a farmer. The monkey set the snake free.
P4	The snake went away without thanking the monkey. The snake felt bad due to his friend's deed.
P5	One day while the monkey was jumping from one stone to another, it slipped and went between the stones. Even if it tried to come out, it failed to do so. As a result, it started to wait for another animal to come and rescue it.
P6	Then the snake saw the monkey and enquired what happened. The monkey told the snake about the accident. Then it asked the snake for help.
P7	The snake said that it couldn't assit the monkey because the snake was thin. The monkey responded that the snake could help him by calling another animal. But the snake said it wouldn't do that and walked away.
P8	Being in a sad mood, the monkey started waiting for another animal. Then the ape that the monkey teased saw the monkey while the ape was passing by. It asked and learned about the situation. The monkey asked for help and the ape helped.
P9	The monkey felt happy and appologized for teasing the ape in the past. They started living together. They became good friends.
