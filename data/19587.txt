page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a man and his wife. They had a beautiful daughter called Sofia. Sofia was the only child of her parents.
P2	Sofia grew up to be a very curious child. She explored the area around her home discovering new things and new places. She asked many questions.
P3	One day Sofia noticed something moving in the bushes near the tree where she liked to play. It was a short woman carrying twigs in her hand. The woman's hair was long,  her mouth and eyes were small.
P4	Sofia ran back home wondering who the strange short woman was. She asked her father but her father was busy repairing his bicycle. Disappointed,  she went to ask her mother.
P5	Sofia's mother warned her saying,  "She is an ogre. She changes into a woman when she goes out of her house. Don't go near that bush again."
P6	Sofia was too curious to remember what her mother had warned her not to do. She kept going back to the tree to see the small woman.
P7	One day,  Sofia saw the small woman carrying wild berries in her hands. Sofia followed her from a distance. The woman noticed and hid so when Sofia was closer,  the woman grabbed her,  dragged her to her hut and locked her in.
P8	As soon as she locked the door,  the woman changed into an ogre. Her hair was shorter,  she became taller and her eyes and mouth were wider.
P9	Sofia's eyes grew wider with fear. She could neither move nor shout. The ogre just laughed at Sofia and said,  "This is a very good day for me."
P10	When Sofia did not return home that evening,  her mother who was sickly,  became worse and was admitted in hospital. Sofia's father had to do everything alone. As the police continued to search for Sofia,  her father became sad and lonely.
P11	The ogre heard the news about Sofia's mother. She thought,  "It is my chance to take the place of this girl's mother." The ogre went out and changed into a beautiful woman. When she returned,  she pretended that she could rescue Sofia and take her to her home.
P12	On the way,  Sofia noticed that the woman kept changing her shape. She did not want to walk in front of Sofia. At some stage,  her eyes became larger and when Sofia asked her,  she said,  "It is because of the hot sun."
P13	When they reached Sofia's home,  Sofia's father was happy to see his daughter again. Although Sofia was happy to be back home,  she missed her mother very much.
P14	Sofia's father fell in love with the beautiful woman who brought back Sofia. He wanted her to stay with them but Sofia was not sure about her. She tried to tell her father,  but he said,  "We need someone to help us. She is a good woman."
P15	One day Sofia heard the woman singing: I daughter of the ogres I melt if I touch sugar. Don't leave sugar nearby. Or you won't see me again.
P16	When the woman was sleeping under the tree, Sofia poured a bowl of sugar onto her. The woman melted and turned into a big stone. Sofia's father said, "I should have listened to you." Her mother returned from hospital and they lived happily.
