P1	Blue! Wait! Stop I know your dining this stop!!!!!! Shouted Vines everything went black I woke up in a tank of water desprit to get to get out but there were two other girls one blonde haired girl named galexa the other brown hair is cloud.
P2	People were trying to attack me! But I was in a tank couple days later I had to eat fish! üêü I'm vegetarian to sea animals so I became powerless for 2 days then I went out of my tank know one noticed so I went out and ran then a arrow came.
P3	I dodged by turning all around me in water I quickly let out galexa and cloud we ran for hours I went to my house with galexa and cloud and Vines was there crying I helped her she hugged me as soon as she saw me I missed her it was 2 days..
P4	Then a strange guy came in he said in a mysterious voice hello Vines, Blue, cloud and galexa you guys all have magic and you all will be using it for good if u don't you will die... I was Roling with it because I was tired he offered food!.
P5	After we met him we went on missions and saved the world although I missed normal life u was 14! So I went into school with my twin Vines and cloud galexa was 20 so she got a job writer in the future I was a artist and Vines was a architect
P6	Cloud was a weather person and we all loved happily ever after
