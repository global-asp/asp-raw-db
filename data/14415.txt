page_text:

P1	Long time ago,  animals had no legs. They all used to crawl.
P2	Only people had legs, which Maguru gave to them. 
P3	One day,  Maguru decided to give legs to every animal. He wanted all the animals to walk. 

He told them about it.
P4	The animals were happy. They wanted to have legs to walk and run. 

They sang and danced.
P5	The animals said it was hard to crawl. They felt pain.
P6	When the day came, many animals crawled to Maguru's house.

Giraffes, lions, elephants, rabbits, crocodiles and birds stood in a line.
P7	Each animal was given four legs.

Birds were given two legs each.
P8	Animals were different when they got legs. 

Some danced for joy. 

Other animals fell down.
P9	They went to show humans. 

The animals said, "We will never crawl again."
P10	The last animal in the line was Millipede. Maguru asked,  "Is there anyone else after you?" 

Millipede answered, "No,  I am the last one."
P11	Maguru thought, "He is the last one. What will I do with the rest of the legs?"

Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
P12	Millipede was very happy. He said, "I will move faster than others."
P13	After Millipede left, Snake came to Maguru's house. He said to Maguru, "Please give me some legs."
P14	Maguru said,  "I have given out all the legs. Where were you?" 

Snake answered, "I over-slept."
P15	Maguru looked to see if there were legs remaining. 

He did not find any.
P16	Maguru said to Snake, "Sorry. There are no legs left." Snake crawled home without legs. 

From that day, Snake does not sleep much. He is waiting to be first in line to get legs.
