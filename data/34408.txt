page_text:

P1	One morning, when Kenneth and Zanele were going to school, they saw a man lying very still on the ground. @@At their water safety lessons, they had learned about emergencies and how do CPR. @@They decided to check if the man was breathing.
P2	Kenneth tapped the man on his shoulders and loudly said, "Baba, hello! Baba, hello?" @@"He's not breathing," whispered Zanele.@@"Call the free emergency number 112 for an ambulance!" yelled Kenneth.
P3	Zanele dialed 112 on her cell phone. @@"Hello operator. I'm next to the Spaza shop on Emms Drive in Nyanga," said Zanele clearly. @@"I think that a man here had a heart attack. He is not breathing. We can try CPR," she added.
P4	"Ok, I'm sending an ambulance," replied the operator. @@She continued, "You know how to do CPR? Push hard and fast in the middle of the man's chest. Keep going. A person can only live for three to four minutes without breathing!"
P5	Both children knew the how to do Hands-on CPR. An instructor from the National Sea Rescue Institute came to their school to teach water safety classes.@@(CPR is short for Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation. Knowing how to do CPR can save a life if someone is not breathing.)
P6	Kenneth was still pushing on the man's chest when the ambulance arrived. @@"We can take over now. You did a great job calling 112 for help and then doing Hands-on CPR," said one medic to Zanele and Kenneth.@@The ambulance took the man to hospital.
P7	"Yoh! I'm glad we paid attention during the water safety course and learned CPR," said Kenneth.@@Zanele nodded and replied, "I'm glad that we know what to do in emergencies!"
P8	When the children saw the Sea Rescue Instructor at school again, they told him about their experience. @@"I'm so proud of you guys, well done! You remembered everything I taught you!" he said. "But also remember, never practice CPR on a friend!"
