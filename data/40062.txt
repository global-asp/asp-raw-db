P1	Once upon a time. There were fishes living in the pond.
P2	One day kids saw them and decided to go and swim with them.@@Their aim was to catch some of those fishes.
P3	While they were inside, a fisherman saw them and told them it's not safe getting inside the pond.
P4	The kids listened to the fisherman, and they never came back to play with water in the pond.
P5	The kids caught some fishes, to play with at home since they can't risk playing at the pond.
