P1	Sam's mother had traveled for a week, so his father was the one taking care of him.
P2	So the next morning Sam was getting ready for school.
P3	Sam's dad prepared some oats.
P4	Sam was so happy when he saw the food.
P5	His dad gave him some milk.
P6	He asked his dad for some sugar. When his dad brought the sugar he was confused because they were two bottles instead of one, when he asked his dad he said he didn't know which bottle containing the sugar.
P7	So he guessed and chose the bottle in front of him but he became sad because he thought it might be salt.
P8	But his dad told him not to worry because it's sugar and poured a lot for so that it would be sweet.
P9	Sam thought of it again but then he remembered what his dad said and ate it.
P10	When he had the first bite he was in shock and he shouted "Dad it was salt!"
P11	His dad was sad and said,sorry next time I'll not pour a lot sorry now your bus is in I'll give you extra pocket money. Sam told his dad that it's fine don't feel dad I'll use the extra pocket money you've given me.
P12	After school, when his mom came he told her the story and they all laughed and had fun.
