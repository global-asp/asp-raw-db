page_text:

P1	The rains did not come. The land was very dry.
P2	This monkey left home to look for water and food.
P3	She walked over hills and valleys.
P4	She came to a place named Tirkol.
P5	Monkey was very happy in this place.
P6	She ate fruit and got fat. But she missed her friends.
P7	So Monkey made the long journey home.
P8	The other monkeys were joyful to see her.
P9	"Where is this wonderful place with fruit?" they asked her.
P10	"I will take you there," said Monkey.
P11	The other monkeys loved Tirkol. They decided to stay there forever.
P12	But the monkeys from Tirkol were worried.
P13	"These new monkeys will eat all our fruit," they said.
P14	The Tirkol monkeys went to attack the new monkeys.
P15	"Why fight?" asked an elder. "There is enough fruit for all!"
P16	This was true. So the monkeys decided to live together peacefully.
