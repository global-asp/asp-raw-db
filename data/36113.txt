page_text:

P1	Awal and his wife, Khadija, lived in a village called Mangu. @@Although Awal had a loose tongue he was a very hard working farmer. @@He went to the farm every day. His dog named 'Noproblem' usually followed him to the farm.
P2	One day at the farm, Awal walked around the part he had not yet finished weeding.@@With only one hoe in his hand, Awal laughed aloud, "Ha, ha, ha, aa! Rain or shine I will finish weeding today."
P3	While he was weeding, Khadija arrived with his food. She was happy with her husband's work.
P4	Khadija decided to support Awal by singing a song.
P5	The song encouraged Awal to weed more. @@He was now weeding very fast, throwing the soil to his left and to his right. He did not rest.
P6	Aweh became very tired. He needed to rest.@@He sat on his hoe's handle to rest. He said to Khadija, "With you here, there is nothing that can stop me from finishing the weeding."@@He challenged, "God can even come down, nothing will stop me from finishing."
P7	Just then, Noproblem came running chasing a rabbit.@@Awal stood up and threw his hoe at the rabbit. The handle hit the ground and broke into pieces.
P8	The rabbit was gone. The dog returned panting and gasping for breath.@@Awal and Khadija stood without talking. The dog wagged its tail while going round them. @@Who is to blame?
