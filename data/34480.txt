P2	Samuel had a friend called Ameze. She always advised Samuel not to steal, but he would never listen.Samuel's friend told him that the mango tree was not his to take from.
P3	One day as he stole a mango from the tree, he got stomach pain because he eat an unripe mango and he didn't wash it. He had to go to the hospital for a check up.
P4	When he got to the hospital, "The doctor asked him," Why did you not wash the fruit before eating?" Samuel replied, " It looked okay as it was." The doctor told him that eating unwashed fruits were bad.
P5	After the warnings from the doctor, Samuel asked the doctor for the drugs and took the drugs home. After that experience, Samuel promised never to eat fruits unwashed ever again and he turned over a new leaf.
