P1	Our journey started on Friday at 12 oclock. My aunt said we were travelling to Nairobi to visit her friend. We went to Mombasa first and slept at grandmothers home. At 6 in the morning, we walked five minutes to reach the train station.
P2	The station is called Chimanzi station. My aunt went to get the tickets which she had paid for earlier. She got them from the counter after standing on the line for five minutes. We then sat at the waiting area with many other passengers.
P3	A woman came and asked me what food I would like to eat. I told her that I like rice and beans. My aunt said she will pay for the food. I was very excited that she did so. The food was sweet and I was very satisfied.
P4	After two hours of waiting, a voice came out of the speakers saying those traveling to Nairobi should be ready to go to the train. Many other passengers walked to the train with us. I was excited to enter the train for the first time.
P5	We put our luggage and took our seats. I was very happy when the train started moving. After some hours, my aunt told me we were passing Tsavo National park. She asked me to look out the window to see wild animals like lions and elephants.
P6	After a few minutes, I saw zebras running. I was very excited. Then we passed a group of elephants that were drinking water. I saw giraffes in the far distance. My aunt promised to take me to the park when I pass my exams. I was very happy
P7	3 hours later, a voice came from the train speakers saying we were now in Nairobi. We were happy our journey was exciting. Aunt Mary told me her friend was waiting outside the train to welcome us. We were all happy to meet him.
