P3	However, when Kukuye came back from collecting food, she couldn't find the bag. @@Kukuye was surprised. She never thought she could lose that bag.
P4	Kakuye searched for the bag everywhere. @@She wept. She thought, "Who could have taken my bag?"
P5	Kakuye thought, "Perhaps my friend Boru knows where my bag is." @@She ran to Boru to ask if he might have seen it.
P6	When Kukuye reached Boru's place, she started explaining to him. @@Before she finished speaking, Boru showed her the bag. @@Kukuye was very happy.
P7	Kakuye asked Boru what had happened. @@Boru told Kukuye that he took the bag because he thought she had lost it.
