page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  there was a girl by the name of Ketty.
P2	Whenever her mother asked Ketty to do anything,  she would refuse.
P3	One day Ketty's mother was sick. She asked Ketty to go to her grandmother and get medicine. On her way to grandmother,  Ketty decided to swim in the river.
P4	As the day passed,  it began to get dark. Ketty's mother and father began to worry.
P5	Her mother called the neighbours to help look for Ketty. Everyone was worried about the monster who eats children at night.
P6	The monster lived in the forest nearby. It slept all day. At night it went looking for children to eat.
P7	While people were searching for Ketty,  she was still having fun in the river.
P8	The monster woke up and started looking for his supper. As he was walking,  he smelled a child in the river. The neighbours were also getting closer to the river.
P9	Ketty saw the monster coming and screamed as loudly as she could. She hid in a bush by the river.
P10	The neighbours heard Ketty scream. They ran towards her voice. They found Ketty hiding. She was very scared.
P11	From that day,  Ketty learned to listen to her mother.
