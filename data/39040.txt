page_text:

P1	My name is Tonica. I am a 10 year old girl.
P2	I may look like an ordinary girl, from the pictures that you've seen. I want you to go back to my picture and look at the top of my head. Hmmmmm where's my hair?
P3	I have always had a head full of hair. In fact mom says I'm the hairiest baby she had ever seen. I'm her eldest, so I doubt she has seen many babies before me.
P4	A lot of work goes into maintaining my hair. This journey has been a learning experience for both mom and I. Mom loves sayin, 'Always remember, deep conditioning is your busherati's best friend."@@Yep, my hair has an actual name, Busherati.
P5	A protective style often follows a successful wash day. Mom says we need to tame my mane. This saves us a lot of time on school days. @@We just spritz and go!
P6	I remember having an argument with my grade 1 teacher. I was sharing my news about my hair that was bigger than the last time. She said, "I'm sure you mean longer." I said, "no ma'am, I definitely meant bigger."
P7	She tried explaining that hair grows long. I told her, "not mine, please just wait and see."@@Needless to say, she was blown away at the next civvies day!
P8	Later that year, my ballet instructor, sent a note home. She told mom, I needed a perfect ballerina bun for my recital. She advised her to either straighten my hair or braid it. @@Mom didn't do any of the two. She embraced the challenge.
P9	That day, while mom was brushing (and I was suffering), I asked mom why my hair grew up and not down. She said, "Miss T you were born to stand out. Can you imagine how boring the world would be if we all looked the same?"
P10	I pointed out to her that even the ladies in my books had long, flowing hair. She decided to read a few with curly haired characters.@@I fell in love with those. They weren't needy. Instead, they were warrior princesses, just like me;
P11	Ever since that day, I fell in love with my crown. @@I am Tonica Matthews, the warrior princess, whose hair grows up and not down!
