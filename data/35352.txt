page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there lived a man called Kanguma. He lived with his wife named Mugure. He was a very rich man. They lived for ten years without being blessed with a baby.
P2	Kanguma had amazing strength. When walking he could shook the ground like sheep during the grazing time. He had many sheep. However, his strength and wealth was not enough to give him a child with his wife Kui, who was a beautiful woman.
P3	The Kanguma family decided to consult a traditional healer named  Mwambele. They believed that where there is a will there is always a way.  When they visited him, they were given two roses of different colours and were told to select one.
P4	After one year, the family was blessed with a beautiful girl. She was named Kui which means a singer. Husband and wife loved their baby.  She brought happiness to the family and they chose to take her to the best school in the town.
P5	One day after school, her parents were late to pick her up. She decided to walk home although she had never done this before. As she started walking down the street, the rain fell suddenly. She enjoyed walking but forgot about  her books.
P6	The parents went to pick her but didn't find her. They looked for her so that they could protect her from rain. Poor Kui did not know about the secret and enjoyed the rain. After that a small snake entered her stomach and grew everyday.
P7	Kanguma and his wife searched for Mwambale. They travelled North, South, East and West but couldn't find him. After along search they were informed  he died long time ago. They were refered to another traditional healer called Kombele.
P8	They went to look for Kombele who advised them to build a wooden canoe and load it with Kui's belongings, razor blade and the amulet they were given by Mwambale. Later set it adrift into the sea. The parents worked hard to build it.
P9	Kui's parents helped each other to take the canoe to the sea as Kombele had instructed them not to be assisted by anybody. They prayed and managed to put the canoe to the sea. The canoe went all the way to Shangawe, a very ancient village.
P10	The canoe arrived safely and was taken by queen Taula. She treated Kui using her belongings and eventually appeared. Kui's parents were very happy and gave him lots of gifts. Later Kui fell in love with the son of the queen, prince Oman.
P11	After six months wedding arrangements started. Queen's family paid dowry to Kui's parents. During the wedding thousands of camels, cows, goats, sheep and countless chicken were slaughtered. Many people were invited from all over the world.
P12	The families organized many types of cultural dances. The wedding was very colourful. After that the bride, bridegroom  and their parents boarded a ship to visit Mwambale's grave yard.  A huge crowd bid them farewell  and prayers were said.
P13	The families sailed safely and visited Mwambale's grave yard. Then later some rituals were performed.  After that they lived happily.
