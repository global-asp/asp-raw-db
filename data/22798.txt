page_text:

P1	Ramuramu was a very noisy goat. 

He would cry, "Meeeeh," while others slept.
P2	One day, he kicked the gate to his pen and it opened. He fell down and looked up. He was free!

There was a wonderful world out there to see!
P3	Alariwo, the little farm dog saw him. "Woof! Woof!" he barked. "You cannot go!" 

The goat headbutted him.
P4	Ramuramu ran up the hill. He looked at the sky. "Ehen!" he cried. "Now I am free!"

He felt like he could fly.
P5	He jumped and slid down the hill, laughing until he hit something. 

"Gbam!" He had landed next to Salewa, the cow.
P6	Ramuramu sniffed the grass and started to munch. Then he spat out the grass, wrinkling his face.
P7	Next, he saw chickens eating corn, and chased them around. Their feathers floated all over the place.

The chickens cried, "Cluck, cluck!"
P8	Ramuramu stole a yam tuber from a pig.

He ran very quickly with his loot!
P9	He soon found sweet grass with silly sheep. 

Ramuramu walked over and munched that grass.
P10	He heard a strange whistle that made the sheep gather and run. 

But Ramuramu lay down and started to sleep.
P11	He heard a wild, wild laugh that woke him up. 

He sniffed a strong, strong smell that made him afraid.
P12	Ramuramu ran with all his might, as the evil laughter followed him.

He ran and ran, back to his safe pen. 

He never ran away again.
