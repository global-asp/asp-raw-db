page_text:

P1	In a village named Masau, lived a king named Abednego. He loved wearing a new dress every day. He wanted clothes no one in the village had never seen before.
P2	One day, he hired weavers from a far land to sew him a cloth and they said they will make him an invisible cloth.
P3	The king told his chiefs to check what the weavers were doing. They knew King Abednego wanted strange clothes. So they told him that they were doing well.
P4	When the cloth was done, he told the villagers of it and set a day to wear it.
P5	When it was done, he wore it. He went around proudly showing the villagers his cloth.
P6	When people saw him, he was naked and they whispered, "The King has gone mad. He is walking naked".
P7	The news spreaded round the village.  When villagers saw him, they ran into their houses. Children ran after him. They called him "the naked king".
P8	His messengers and bodyguards quickly got him an older cloth. But he was known round the village as the "naked king" because of the invisible cloth he wore.
