page_text:

P1	Musa lives with his parents in the village of Kagadama, in Nigeria. 

He is an intelligent boy, but he is stubborn.
P2	Musa is also a bully. He always beats his friends. 

Whenever he comes across animals he also beats them.
P3	One day on his way back from school, he sees a cat. 

He picks up the cat and goes home with it.
P4	When his father sees him, he says "Musa stop abusing that cat! Take it back to where you found it."
P5	Musa refuses to return the cat and locks it in a cage.
P6	As he is sleeping in his room that night, Musa has a dream. 

Musa sees the cat growing bigger and running towards him. Its mouth is open, with sharp teeth. It wants to eat him!
P7	The cat starts to swallow his feet. It eats half way up to Musa's knees. 

Then he wakes up.
P8	The next day Musa returns the cat to where he found it. 

From then, he promises to be a good boy.
