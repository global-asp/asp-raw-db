page_text:

P1	Adina is an elderly woman who lives on a farm. She has a garden with different kinds of flowers, but her favourite are sunflowers. Adina usually takes a walk in her garden of flowers each morning, just after sunrise.
P2	One morning, as she was taking her usual walk through her garden of flowers, the weather started to change all at once. It became cloudy and darker then suddenly lightning struck. Adina got startled by the sudden change of weather.
P3	She had to make her way back to the house as it was starting to rain. As Adina was rushing back, she slipped on a small puddle of water on the grass and she had a bad fall.
P4	Adina's fall put her in bed for a while because she had injured her back. She could no longer go for her morning walk in the garden. Her neighbours went to visit her and she told them how much she missed her walk in the garden of flowers.
P5	Adina was sad. She felt heartbroken. Her neighbours decided to pick one of Adina's sunflowers and bring it to her. Adina was extremely excited when she took a glance, smelled her favourite flower and immediately she felt better.
