page_text:

P1	Hare and Monkey were great friends. They did everything together.
P2	One day Hare said,  "Let us go and look for food." Monkey accepted without knowing what was waiting for him!
P3	They went into some people's farm and began to eat maize. Hare had been jealous of Monkey because of his long tail. He had planned to make Monkey look foolish.
P4	Hare had talked to the owners of the maize about Monkey. "Monkey will come to eat your maize today. Teach him a lesson!"
P5	When they were eating the maize,  Hare hid and began shouting,  "Thief! Thief! Your maize is being eaten!" After that,  he ran away. Monkey did not know what was going on.
P6	Suddenly,  the owners arrived and found Monkey trying to run away. He did not get far because of his long tail.
P7	They shouted,  "Stop! Stop! You have eaten all our maize." Monkey kept running hoping to get away.
P8	The owners caught him and started beating him. Monkey tried hard to escape but he was unable to.
P9	Monkey could not put up with the pain any more. He begged the owners to let him explain what had happened. "I was with my friend Hare. He is the one who invited me," he cried.
P10	They did not listen to Monkey. One of them took out a sharp machete saying,  "This is the day we were waiting for! We will teach you a lesson!" He cut off Monkey's tail. Hare saw where the tail was thrown so he hid it.
P11	After the owners left,  Monkey ran to escape more beating. Meanwhile,  Hare took Monkey's tail to go and cook it. "I will then invite Monkey for lunch," he smiled.
P12	After the meal,  Monkey said,  "Thank you my friend for serving such a delicious meal." Hare asked Monkey if he knew what he had eaten. Monkey answered,  "No,  I don't."
P13	Hare said,  "That delicious meal that you have just eaten,  is your tail." After saying that,  he ran away. From that day,  the two became enemies!
