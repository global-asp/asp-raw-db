page_text:

P1	There was a father who had two sons.
P2	The younger son said to his father, "Father, give me my share of the inheritance."
P3	So the father divided the property between them.
P4	Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had.@@He set off for a distant country.
P5	He used his wealth in wild living.
P6	The son lacked discipline. @@He wasted everything that he had.
P7	After he had spent everything, there was severe famine in the whole county.
P8	He begin to hurt.@@He needed food and other basic needs.
P9	So he went out to look for work.@@He was hired by a citizen of that country to feed his pigs.
P10	He was very hungry. @@He wished he could eat some of what the pigs were eating.
P11	But no one gave him anything.@@That hurt him very much.
P12	Then he come to his senses, he said...
P13	My father's servants have food to spare.@@But here I am starving to death!
P14	I will go back to my father, and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you."
P15	"I am no longer worthy to be called your son! Just hire me like the men who work for you."
P16	So he got up and went to his father.
P17	But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him. @@He was filled with compassion for him.
P18	He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.@@The son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son."
P19	But the father said to his servants, "Quickly! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it."
P20	"Let's have a feast and celebrate. This son of mine was dead  and is alive again. He was lost and now is found."
P21	So they began to celebrate.
P22	Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard the music and saw people dancing.
P23	So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. "Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he is back safe and sound," he replied.
P24	The older brother became  angry  and refused to go in.@@So his father went out and pleaded with him.
P25	But he answered his his father, "Look! All those years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so l could  celebrate with my friends."
P26	"But when this son of yours who has squandered  your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him."@@His father said, "My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours."
P27	"But we have to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. Let's celebrate!"
