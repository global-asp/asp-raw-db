page_text:

P1	Long,  long time ago,  animals used to speak.  There lived Hare and Hyena.
P2	The two were very closed friends.  They did everything together including looking for food.
P3	Hare was very clever. She gathered more food than the lazy Hyena.
P4	Hyena was lazy but he liked eating very much. Although they hunted differently,  they put the food together.
P5	Hare used her tricks to get food faster.   She also ate some before taking it to where Hyena was.
P6	During the drought,  it was very hard for the two to gather enough food for themselves.
P7	One day,  Hare woke Hyena up very early in the morning. They stood under a tree to discuss how they were going to live.
