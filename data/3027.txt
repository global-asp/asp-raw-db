desc:	A poem about a girl who loves to dance. Her teacher finds this irritating

page_text:

P1	I dance when I am happy,  I dance when I am sad,  I dance when I am lonely,  I dance when I am mad.
P2	My teacher says,  "Sit still! Don't dance about all day."
P3	But my mother says,  "Dancing makes you healthy,  Dancing makes you tall,  One day you'll be a dancer,  And surprise them all!"
P4	And I say,  "One day I'll dance and people will pay Just to see me leap and twirl" 'Her dancing is SO good',  they'll say.
