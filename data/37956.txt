page_text:

P1	Sunrise signifies the beginning of a new day, full of hopes & wishes. One morning Matilda woke up very happy and wanted to have a good time in the garden. The sun was her greatest gloom and comforter, she always admired the beauty of nature
P2	The garden was blooming with spring flowers and where flowers bloom, so does hope. The scent of flowers was thick in the air. Suddenly the weather changed and Matilda wanted to have as many flowers as she can but she couldn't.
P3	Matilda wondered. The weather became very wet and ghastly in the blink of an eye, she was frightened. She wanted to go home immediately but the weather couldn't allow her to walk all by herself. Lightning became very strong.
P4	As Matilda then decided to go home she slipped and fall down. she survived after being struck by lightning while she was running. The only thing Matilda wanted was to cut those sunflowers and arrange them beautifully at her place.
P5	Matilda's family was sad and shocked that she didn't experience any cardiac arrest which stops a person's body from circulating blood and causes direct injury to the brain and nervous system. She only had minor injuries on her forehead.
P6	She believed that "nature never betray those who know how to adapt and those who adores it". Every moment she spends alone with the mother nature is always a sunshine to her soul.
