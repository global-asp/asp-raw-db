page_text:

P1	Sidney is a little girl who lives with her mother. Although she was small she had a big dream. She always wanted to go to the circus since she first read a story about circus animals.
P2	One night after Sidney's mother kissed her goodnight she told her that they will be going to the circus the following day. Extremely excited Sidney hugged her mom and went right to sleep.
P3	In Sidney's dream she came across a beautiful tent and immediately assumed it was a circus tent. "Yes,  it sure is," she said as there was a clown standing right next to the entrance.
P4	It had such pretty golden brown hair with thick brown mane. It was completely tame with no intention to harm anyone. "Oh what a big lion," she shouted.
P5	Sidney then entered the colourful tent and continue being amazed. She saw four more wild animals,  this time they were quite small. They jumped in the air and did a few awesome tricks.   "Oh what small monkeys," she whispered.
P6	What Sidney saw next made her laugh and laugh and laugh. An animal that is usually in water,  were dancing and clapping its flippers. Not only was it dancing but balancing a purple ball with its nose. "Oh what a big seal," she shouted.
P7	An animal with grey leather skin gave a   trumpet and made the whole crowd cheer of joy. It climbed upon a little stepping stool and started dancing. With its trunk it balanced a big ball while standing on only its hind legs. "Oh what a big elephant," she shouted.
P8	A tall man with big shoes made the whole crowd laugh with his jokes. He tied balloons in animal shapes for all the children.   "Oh what a funny clown," she shouted.
P9	One,  two,  three,  four bears were handing out balloons and flowers for each person as a keepsake for their attendance at the circus. "Oh what small bears they were," she said.
P10	Suddenly Sidney's mom woke her up to get dressed and eat breakfast before their journey to the circus. When they arrived at the tent,  Sidney saw a wild animal standing right next to the entrance. "Oh what a big lion," she shouted. It was exactly like her dream.
