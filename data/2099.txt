P1	After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say,  "Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?" Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree,  but he trusted Ngede.
P2	After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say,  "Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?" Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree,  but he trusted Ngede.
P3	So Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree,  gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire. When the fire was burning well,  he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began climbing,  holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth.
P4	Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their hive. When Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came rushing out,  angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke – but not before they had given Gingile some painful stings!
P5	When the bees were out,  Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb,  dripping with rich honey and full of fat,  white grubs. He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder,  and started to climb down the tree.
P6	Ngede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Ngede flittered from branch to branch,  closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree. Ngede perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward.
P7	Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile,  he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch,  and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him,  Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Ngede,  the Honeyguide,  had his revenge. And Gingile learned his lesson.
P8	And so,  when the children of Gingile hear the story of Ngede they have respect for the little bird. Whenever they harvest honey,  they make sure to leave the biggest part of the comb for Honeyguide!
