page_text:

P1	There was a stray cat called Meow and a little girl named Amelia who was 6 almost 7 in a couple of days. While she was playing in a park, she heard a meow. Then a cute white and brown cat came. Amelia always wanted a cat.
P2	But her mum and dad never let her have one so she went home with the cat, showed her mum and dad and they said"Lets take it to the vet''. So they went to the vet and the vet said that they could keep it since it's a stray cat.
P3	So on the way home, they brought a collar  with some cat food. At home, they were preparing for Amelia's 7th birthday, but on  the day of Amelia's 7th birthday, Meow was gone. Amelia was devasted so they put missing posters in the town.
P4	Then Meow came back just in time for Amelia's 7th birthday party and they all danced together.@The End
