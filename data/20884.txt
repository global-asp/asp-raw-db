P1	Long ago, animals had no legs.
P2	Maguru had given legs only to people.
P3	Maguru decided to give legs to every animal.
P4	The animals wanted legs to walk and run.
P5	It was hard for them to crawl.
P6	When the day came, different animals crawled to Maguru's house.
P7	Maguru gave legs to animals and birds.
P8	Some animals danced, while others fell down.
P9	They said, "We will never crawl again."
P10	Millipede was the last animal on the line.
P11	Maguru gave Millipede all the remaining legs.
P12	Millipede said happily, “I will move faster than others.”
P13	After Millipede, Snake came begging, “Please give me some legs.”
P14	Snake said to Maguru, “I over-slept.
P15	Maguru did not find any legs for Snake.
P16	From that day, Snake still waits to get legs.
