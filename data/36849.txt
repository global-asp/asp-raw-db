P4	“Here is the shopping list and the money. If you have money left, you can buy sweets for yourselves!”
P5	The three children walk to the supermarket.
P6	“This is the list that Mama gave us.”
P7	“So what do we need exactly? Oh, so many things.”
P8	The three children put the groceries in the shopping basket.
P9	“This should be everything! How much does it cost? Let’s calculate!”
P10	Now the children know how much it costs. @“But how much money do we have left for sweets?”
