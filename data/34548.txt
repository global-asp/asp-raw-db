P1	If someone is in water, you can use a stick to pull the person to safety. @@Never get into the water to try and rescue someone. @@If you get into the water, you could also drown.
P2	If the person who needs help is too far away from you to reach with a stick, you can throw something that floats.@@Throw something they can hold on to and use to stay above the water. You could throw a soccer ball or an empty five-litre plastic container.
P3	If someone needs rescuing from water, ask a lifeguard or adult for help. Never go into the water to try and rescue someone yourself. @@You can also call the free national emergency number, 112, from a cell phone or a landline.
P4	If someone is rescued from the water and they are not breathing, you should call 112 for help. @@You can then start Hands-on CPR by pushing hard and fast in the centre of their chest. Do not practice this on a friend!@@You can find out more from the National Sea Rescue Institute.
