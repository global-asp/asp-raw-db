page_text:

P1	Long time a go there lived Tortoise. He was very very slow. Tortoise was travelling for a long time in the heat. He decided to seek help from his friend Bird who had wings.
P2	Bird agreed to carry Tortoise. Tortoise was so happy.  He promised Bird some maize grains if they arrived safely.
P3	Bird gave Tortoise instructions on how to carry him. He said,   "You must hold me tightly while I fly. You should not shake."
P4	Tortoise was afraid of falling. Since it was getting late,  he decided to risk.
P5	The journey started off well. The two friends held onto each other tightly as they flew in the air. They talkded happily.
P6	Bird flew higher than usual. Tortoise forgot the instruction that Bird had given him. Tortoise was afraid.
P7	Then the wind began to blow. Bird shook and Tortoise lost his grip.  Tortoise fell on the rocks bellow.
P8	Tortoise cried for help. "I have lost my beauty," he cried. He had a smooth scull before but now it was full of cracks. Bird flew down to help his friend.
P9	Bird hugged Tortoise and comforted him. They went home happily.
P10	This is the reason why Tortoise has cracks on his shell.
