desc:	The hungry jackal sees Crow flying with a piece of cheese in his beak

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time Jackal was walking around the bush. He was very hungry. He saw Crow flying above the trees with a big piece of cheese in his mouth.
P2	"Hmmmthat cheese looks delicious! I must find a way to get it," thought Jackal. "Oh,  I have a plan!" said Jackal to himself while wiping his mouth quickly. He did not want Crow to notice that he was hungry.
P3	Crow had been flying the whole morning. He was tired. He decided to sit on a branch of a tree. Jackal sat down under the tree where Crow was sitting.
P4	Jackal called with a huge smile,  "Hello Crow! You're looking very good today. Your feathers look glossy and healthy. You must be taking very good care of yourself."
P5	Crow was very flattered to hear this. Crow always thought he was the strongest and most beautiful of all the other birds.
P6	"I hear you also have the most beautiful singing voice of all the other birds. Won't you sing a song for me this morning?"
P7	Crow was so flattered that he stretched his wings and prepared to sing for the jackal. He pushed his chest out and let out a loud pitched sound.
P8	As Crow started singing the cheese fell to the ground,  right in front of Jackal. Crow stopped and looked down. Jackal grabbed the piece of cheese and ran into the bush. Crow was left angry and hungry.
