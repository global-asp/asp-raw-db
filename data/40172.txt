page_text:

P1	One day, Anansi the spider picked up@  some yams in his garden. They were very beautiful and very good yams, so he@  cooked them carefully on the fire. Then he sat down to eat them.
P2	But@  meanwhile, Anansi had started swallowing the yams. When Turtle returned, he@  saw that the yams were gone. Turtle looked at Anansi. "Thank you for@  inviting me to dinner. If you ever come near my house, come see me and let me@  make this dinner for you," he told her. And Turtle started crawling@  slowly towards his house.
P3	But@  without the stones in his pockets to hold him down, Anansi immediately rose@  to the surface of the river and found himself out of the water. Anansi sadly@  put his head in the water and watched Turtle eat all the delicious food!
