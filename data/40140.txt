P1	The long awaited day finally came when we were all prepared for the adventure.We all  gathered at my uncle's place where my cousin was to take us to the adventure.My cousin Amina,Fatima,my uncle,aunt and my younger sister were prepared.
P2	We alk took our breakfast and packed our necessities then took off.Wow! Surely the day was blessed by our forefathers.we were all filled with spams of joy as we were all on high spirit heading to the forest for the day.
P3	Our moods were filled with estacy.By and by we got near the forest where we had  the Big Five  found in the forest. In an  hint of a second we were there On looking  we saw an old man fro a distance.
P4	The old man was looking after his cattles and asked us to take  care  of them as he went somewhere He stayed for a long time without coming back and we were all worried about him.We decided to go in search of him.
P5	We came up with a plan of the search.Each of us went to different direction looking for him.Suddendly l heard some creepy sounds and got flighted.The sounds made my eyes dilate with fear and my legs failed me.I was tongue tied.
P6	I had no choice than to go see for myself.As l stretched my hand over a wild animal jumped out of the bush.It looked harmless and also adorable.In a short while l realized that l was left behind and couldn't find myself back to others.
P7	I sat on a rock perfectly still waiting to see whether l would see anyone from anywhere.Without seeing anyone or anybody @i decided to find my way to them not knowing where am going to.
P8	I sat on the rock perfectly still waiting to see if anyone would show up,but unfortunately no one come so l decided to walk still when l would find them.This was scarely since l didn't know where l was going to and how to find them.
P9	After some time as l was walking along,l heard a strange voice coming from behind.l quickly turned to check what was it about but l couldn't find anyone or anything.l ignored it and continued with my journey
P10	After some time as l was on my way l heard a voice within and said "what are you doing here?"! l was full of fear not knowing what to do or where to go.Whatever it was ,it had succeded in robbing me of my power of speech.
P11	l  was surprised and at the same time shocked.My friends came out of the forest laughing at me.Tears rolled down my eyes as they were busy laughing ,They had prunked me but we hugged each other joyfully.
P12	We all went out of the forest and started our journey back home.The old man came for his cattles and  thanked us so much and gave us a gift for appreciation.We shared the gift and went home happily together.
