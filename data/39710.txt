page_text:

P1	Are you ready to read? Because I am about to tell a story from a long time ago. When humans could understand each other! All right, if you are ready. Turn the page!
P2	Once upon a time, there was a village deep in the forest. In the village, there were 2 friends, Dimabo and Sisengo. They were best friends! Every day, they took a walk in the forest together. Chatting as if they were the best!
P3	One day, when they were chatting in the forest. They started some conversation, " I love your orange and yellow circled dress, Sisengo!" " I love your white and red flowered t- shirt, Dimabo!" But then, they heard footsteps! Kidnappers!
P4	The kidnappers ran after them, Sisengo climbed up a tree, as fast as she could! Dimabo ran to the village to get help! The kidnappers tried their best to get Sisengo down.
P5	The kidnappers tried sweetly telling Sisengo to get down. But Sisengo wasn't tricked! Soon, they sat down under the tree, thinking what they would do to Sisengo. If she went down the tree!
P6	" We'll let the wild animals eat her!" The man said "No, we'll make her our slave!" Soon  they were fighting about what to do with Sisengo! Soon the villagers arrived, they arrested the kidnappers! Dimabo let Sisengo down the tree!
P7	"I was so worried about you!" Cried Dimabo, What were they going to do to you!?" "They couldn't," Sisengo replied, "because they were fighting about what to do with me!" "What fake friends they are! At least, we are real friends!"
P8	They also lived happily ever after! Not having to see the kidnappers ever again!@                              THE END!
