page_text:

P1	It was nearly time for Zethu's graduation. @@Her mother took her to town, to choose her dream dress. @@Zethu tried on many dresses that day.
P2	Finally, she chose a yellow dress with a long skirt that swirled around her knees. @@As they were leaving the shop, she saw an exquisite necklace. Zethu wanted that necklace!
P3	But the necklace was expensive and her mother could not afford it. @@"It is lovely, my angel. I wish I had money to buy the necklace for you," said her mother.
P4	Zethu was disappointed. @@So she decided to save and buy the necklace herself.@@She put all her money in a piggy bank under her bed.
P5	"I will wear that necklace to my next graduation," thought Zethu. @@Eventually, she had saved enough money to buy the necklace.
P6	Then, Zethu remembered that very soon it was her mother's birthday. @@She had no gift for the day. "I've spent all my money, what will I give her?" wondered Zethu.
P7	On the day of her mother's birthday, Zethu went to her bedroom and knocked. @@"Happy birthday, mommy!" she said, giving a gift bag to her mother.
P8	Her mother opened the bag and found the necklace that Zethu liked so much.@@She hugged her daughter and said, "I love you, my angel. You are my gift!"
