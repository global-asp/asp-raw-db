page_text:

P1	My name is Otim Justin Junior. I am a boy aged 10 and I live in Kitgum. I want to become an engineer when I grow up. When I was in P.4,  I used to study at Mother Majeri Primary School but I was changed to St. Jude Primary School in Nakasongola at Kakooge in 2016.
P2	My best dish is chicken and chips.
P3	My best movie is Born to Race. I like Brian in the movie. I like him because he can drive cars so fast.
P4	My favourite football club is Chelsea and I would like to meet Diego Costa before I die.I would like to meet him because he dodges everybody in the pitch.
P5	I would also like to meet President Uhuru Kenyata of Kenya.
P6	I fear ghosts but I don't fear people. That is the end of my story.
