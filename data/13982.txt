page_text:

P1	"Please! Please! Help." What am I going to tell my parents? Giraffe and elephant used to live together in a bamboo forest as great friends. They both gave birth to their young ones.
P2	Bamboo forest was a home of all wild animals and they all lived peacefully. All the animals used to graze in that green bamboo forest.
P3	Little giraffe and little elephant used to go deep in the forest looking for food. Their favourite food was honey.
P4	One day while in the forest,  little elephant looked up the sky and saw a white cloud. He thought it was honey and began to salivate. He asked his friend how they could get to it.
P5	After a while,  little got a solution. He told his friend to climb up the tree in order to get to that honey. Little giraffe agreed.
P6	After the little giraffe had climbed up the tree,  he was unable to reach the sky. Little elephant therefore,  decided to climb another tree so that he could pull little giraffe's ears.
P7	After all that struggle,  the little giraffe realized that his neck had become longer than usual. Then he started crying out for help,  please! Please! Help.
P8	Their friendship ended there and everybody decided to take on his own way deep in the forest. That is why a giraffe has a long neck up to date.
P9	The End.
