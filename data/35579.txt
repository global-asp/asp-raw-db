page_text:

P1	Alhaji Musa lived in the town of Sabon Birnin with his wife and daughter.
P2	He was a businessman but an illiterate. Suddenly, he divorced his wife. Soon, Alhaji Musa's relatives visited him only to discover that their kinsman had divorced his wife and the daughter was left alone.
P3	So, the raelation advised Alhaji Musa to either take a new wife or allow the girl to follow them to the village because there was nobody in the house to take care of the girl whenever the father leaves home.
P4	Luckily,  Alhaji Musa agreed, and the relatives took the girl with them to the the village. When they got to the village, Mallam Shuaibu, a young educated man, saw the girl and asked her relatives to allow him to marry her.
P5	He promised to send her to school as he felt she was too smart to be left uneducated. The family permitted Mallam Shuaibu.
P6	After her marriage, the husband enrolled her in a Yaki Da Jahilci (Adult Education) programme where he became a star in reading, writing and in numeracy.  After Yaki Da Jahilci, she went to College of Education and became a teacher.
P7	So, the man fulfilled his promise and Alhaji Musa, her father, realised that he had made a huge mistake. Even though he was rich and lived in the city, he did not educate his daughter.
P8	On her part, she started teaching children in the village how to read, write, and count.
