page_text:

P1	One day,  king Lion called all the animals for a big meeting. He wanted to discuss how they could protect their environment.
P2	As the animals arrived in large numbers,  king Lion told them to keep quiet.
P3	When everyone was gathered,  Lion said,  "My people,  listen carefully."
P4	"Our enemies are cutting down our trees and burning our bushes. What are we going to do?" asked Lion.
P5	"Girls,  boys,  men and women,  they are all ruining our environment. How can we stop them from destroying our homes?" asked Lion again.
P6	All the animals were sad and worried.
P7	They voted for elephant,  buffalo,  rhinoceros,  and eagle to find a solution to this problem.
P8	These animals decided to arrest humans who were cutting down their trees.
P9	And so they arrested charcoal burners and swamp drainers. They arrested bush burners,  and even some farmers.
P10	Then the animals made a peaceful agreement with humans.
P11	One part of the land would be for animals,  and the other for humans. From that day,  animals no longer worried about human actions.
