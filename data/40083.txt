P1	There lived a boy whose name was Juma.His parents were very rich and he never liked talking to other people, even his neighbors.One day his parents travelled and left him alone. Suddenly it started raining heavily and floods came.
P2	Juma did not know what to do.He started crying because he was frightened.The waters were all over and everything in the house was soaked by the muddy waters.He could not be able to cook.
P3	He then decided to go to his neighbor's house and ask for some food since he was hungry.His neighbor was called Amani.She welcomed him and gave him some food to eat.
P4	Juma thanked her for treating him with kindness.Since that day, Juma learnt that no man is an island and from that day he started loving his neighbors and treated them well.
