page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  Frog and Snake were good friends. Their homes were near each other and their children played together.
P2	One day,  Frog said to Snake,  "My friend I want to visit my mother next week. Would you like to go with me?"
P3	"I would be happy to go," Snake answered. "Very good,  then let's prepare for a long journey," replied Frog. "We also need to find someone to look after our homes while we are away," she added.
P4	They asked Monkey to help since he was good and responsible. Monkey accepted.
P5	During the next few days,  the two friends were busy making arrangements for the journey. Frog collected white ants and packed them in a big sack. Her mother loved to eat white ants.
P6	The day arrived and the two friends set off at dawn. Soon they reached the thick forest. As they entered the forest,  a group of angry squirrels gathered to attack them.
P7	Snake was so afraid that she started shaking. She hissed and hissed but the fierce squirrels kept on coming closer.
P8	Just as the squirrels were about to attack them,  Frog croaked very loudly. The squirrels got such a fright that they ran away.
P9	When the two friends finally arrived at Frog's mother's place,  they were hungry and tired. Frog's mother gave them a mat to sit on while she was preparing food.
P10	When the food was ready,  Frog and Snake washed and sat down to eat.
P11	Before they started eating,  Frog said,  "Snake you can't eat while lying down. That is bad manners. Please sit up properly otherwise my mother will be offended."
P12	Snake tried very hard to sit up like the frogs,  but she failed.
P13	Meanwhile Frog and her mother started eating the food.
P14	"I can't sit up properly," Snake pleaded with Frog. But Frog would not listen.
P15	Snake was so upset that she decided to go back to her home. She did not say farewell to the frogs.
P16	On the way home,  she made a plan to teach Frog a lesson!
