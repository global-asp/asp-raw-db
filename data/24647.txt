page_text:

P1	Long ago deep in middle earth, there was an enchanted land.
P2	The land was filled with creatures of all kinds, and nature had blessed it.
P3	The land had no king or queen.
P4	Everyone was happy, and the creatures lived with one another.
P5	One day an evil creature came from across the lake with its army.
P6	It realised that these people had no king and thought they were foolish.
P7	So it tricked them, saying it had been sent by the gods to be their king.
P8	One day they realised that some animals were disappearing.
P9	In the great meeting Mpologoma said he would investigate the problem.
P10	He came to realise that Musota, the new king, was eating them.
P11	They decided to go to war with Musota. Mpologoma was their leader.
P12	Everyone took part in the war. On Pride Rock Mpologoma killed the snake.
P13	Everyone agreed that Mpologoma and his family would always protect them.
P14	Kamunye from the gods came and told Nfudu the gods had seen everything.
P15	And they were very pleased with the animals, how the Nile was defended.
P16	Nfudu, the eldest, said that from that day the land would be called Nile.
P17	That's how Mpologoma became the king of the Nile, a land of gods.
