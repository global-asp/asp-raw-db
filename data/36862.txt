page_text:

P1	A city called Stony vrook flourished with all technologies anyone could ever imagine.@It has big, tall buildings with lots of shopping malls and other high class facilities.
P2	With increase in everything, there was an increase in garbage. So the city people decided to use the vrook ocean as their dumping site because no inch of land was left to use. Slowly the ocean was filled with lots of garbage.
P3	On the other hand, the ocean world suffered a havoc. Many lives were gone because of the intake of many poisonous things especially plastic which wouldn't decay at all.
P4	All the aquatic species called on for a meeting.
P5	The meeting resulted in making the humans suffer by not providing them with any source of water.
P6	The aquatic king called on with all his allies and made sure no water source was available for them.
P7	Slowly, there was no water left inside the city. People started dying and now there was lot of discussion made over the problem. Finally, they went to the ocean and called for the ocean people for a meet.
P8	The ocean people and humans had a long talk. The ocean king showed them how plastic and all the garbage is ruining their lives and nobody gave dumping into ocean a second thoughts as if there lives were jokes.@Many dead fishes were shown.
P9	Finally, it was decided that how important every life is and so from now on ocean rules were made which included no dumping into ocean and cleaning it and violation of any would lead into no good. Humans followed it.
P10	Now plastic was recylced and many measures were taken to reduce its usage.@Now both lives of land and water were safe.@Moral: everyone of us should think about the oceans and other lives too, which might affect due to our carelss actions.
