P1	Once upon a time in a small village deep in the forest there lived a young boy called Matami.He loved sleeping very much.One day he slept too long and was late to go to school.He rushed but he was too late.
P2	When he arrived at school he was worried that their teacher would punish him.He decided to go to his teacher and explain why he was late.The teacher was so nice and merciful he forgave Matami.
P3	After a long day of reading listening and writing,he finally had some time to rest before going  back home.At home he found his mother had prepared delicious food.He ate hurriedly and went to sleep.
P4	As he was sleeping he had a scary dream,and on his dream he dreamt that all the people in the village were turned into insects by a bad witch.Everyone except him were turned into insects.
P5	Matami wondered why he was the only person who was not turned into an insect.The witch laughed at people but he did not realise that Matami was still a human.@Matami was very scared and decided to go back home.
P6	At their home Matami saw a witch with his wide hat and a pot that has green and glowing potion.The witch also had a ball that he used to see who is not an insect.Then Matami looked for his parents.
P7	Matami did not find his parents anywhere until he saw two big insects.This insects were Matami's parents,but he did not know.Angered by the loss of his parents Matami took the witches wand away from him and took all his power.
P8	The witch tried to trap Matami but failed.Matami used the wand at the witch.The witch started fading and he thought it was real.He woke up shaking and rushed out where he saw everyone."Oh it was just a dream he said" with a pause.
