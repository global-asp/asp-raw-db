P1	Gani lives in town. His mom takes him to the village. In the morning, Gani wants his toys to play with. Unfortunately, he did not bring them.
P2	Gani begins to cry. His cousins have come to greet him.@“We make our own toys here. We will teach you. Follow us!" His cousins say excitedly.
P3	"First, be ready to get dirty!@Dig out some clay.@Make it wet.@Knead it like a dough."
P4	"We make cars, motorbikes, goats, cows or whatever we want.@Today we will teach you how to make a car." His elder cousin said.
P5	"Scoop a piece.@Knead it again.@Flatten it on an even surface.@Smoothen all the sides and edges.@Make a couple of these.@Connect the parts."
P6	"Make the inside parts like seats, steering. Fix them on the base you made earlier."
P7	"Make the wheels.@Shine it with very wet clay.@Vrooom! You have made your first car."
P8	“Gani, your car is not beautiful!” The boys laugh at him.@“You will soon learn how to make beautiful cars.” They encouraged him.
