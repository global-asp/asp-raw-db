P1	I  wonder if  there's another me somewhere in the  world. @@@THOUGHTS  FOR  YOUR  CHILD @@What do you think – is there another animal just like this one, somewhere in the world? @@There are five trees in this picture. @@If you take away the one tree on one side, how many trees are left on the other side?
P2	Who looks  the same. @@@@THINK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING@@When you look in a mirror, or a reflective surface like this  water, you see a reflection of your image. @@An image that has one side that looks like the reflection  of the other side is said to be symmetric. @Most people's faces are very close to being symmetric. @@Do you see some things in your room that are symmetric?
P3	And  talks  the  same. @@@ACTIVITIES@@This animal is listening to its echo across a canyon.  @@Have you ever been someplace where you can hear  an echo? @@Does your echo sound exactly like you, or is it different somehow?
P4	who even has curls just like mine. @@@ACTIVITIES@@The hippo and the mouse both have a tail that is  curled, but they are certainly not the same as our friend. @@Describe some ways that those two animals are  different from our friend. @@Pick someone you know, and describe some ways that you are similar to them and different from them.
P5	Someone with eyes and ears like mine. @@@ACTIVITIES@@This animal has 3 eyelashes on each side. @@How many eyelashes is that all together?
P6	Who even laughs just like me. @@@MORE ACTIVITIES TO DO@@Can you make sounds like some of the animals?  @@Can you neigh like a horse?@@Oink like a pig?@@Meow like a cat, or bray like a donkey?
P7	Who can do what I can do.....@@@THINGS YOUR CHILD DOES@@They are so happy running along together. @@Do you feel happy when you are running freely in a big open  space like that? Do you prefer to run with someone or by yourself? @@They are running by some rocks. How many rocks are there? @@There are two big rocks near the path. If you take the big rocks away, how many rocks are left?
P8	...and can't do what I can't do.@@@DIFFICULT THINGS TO DO@@Why are the animals having trouble peeling a banana?  @@Can you peel a banana easily? @@Are there things, such as fruit or packages, that you  have trouble opening?
P9	I've looked and looked everywhere to find another  me. I went down to the park and looked behind the  trees. @@@THINGS THAT YOUR CHILD WONDERS ABOUT@@What animal did he see when he looked behind the tree? @@Why was it another animal just like him? @@Is that what he was looking for?
P10	I looked up and down, left and right and all around.@@@WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?@@@That first picture is just silly. How would that animal  ever climb to the top of a tree? @@Do you think the bird is surprised to see it there?
P11	I looked at every animal I found.@@@CAN YOUR CHILD ADD NUMBERS?@@There are three animals on one side of the pond and  one more on the other side.  If you put them all together, how many animals are there at the pond? @@Similarly, if you remove the one animal on one side of the pond from the group of four animals that are  at the pond, how many animals are left?@@The two facts – that 3 + 1 = 4 and 4  – 1 =  3 – are tied together and are called a math fact family.
P12	I couldn't find anywhere, anybody who looked just like me.@@@WHAT DOES YOUR CHILD THINK?@@Do you think his shadow temporarily fooled him into thinking that there was another animal just like him?@@Does your shadow look like you? @@Have you ever seen someone's shadow and thought  that the shadow was really a person?
P13	There's only one me in the world! I am very special you see.@@@DIFFERENCES IN ANIMALS@@How many animals can you count in this picture?@@Describe some of the ways that each one of them is different from our friend.
P14	But I am not the only special one. @@There is only one of you too!@@@EACH PERSON IS UNIQUE@@Do you know someone who is very similar to you? Perhaps they are the same age or the same height,  or perhaps their hair is similar to yours.  @@Despite the similarities, they are probably not exactly the same as you.
