desc:	Mr hedgehog is moody today

page_text:

P1	One shiny morning, Mr hedgehog went out of his nest and said: what a harsh sun, it's blinding my eyes!!!
P2	On his lovely trip he said: its too far.!! im tired.
P3	When he met some of his friends on the way, who came to say hello, he thought: the way is too busy!
P4	He cought a beetle to eat, and said: I don't like this food.
P5	If you wake up in the morning able to have a walk in the forest under the sunbeams, to meet your friends and to eat your favourite food, how will you feel? What will you think? And what will you say?
