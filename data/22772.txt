page_text:

P1	Once upon a King who, due to his age decided to adopt a son who will be the heir of his throne because he didn't have any son.
P2	He then, called all villagers and he chose ten young boys to whom he delivered seeds, asked them to go and plant them and after two weeks the one who will bring the best result will be his adopted son and the heir of his throne.
P3	In one family, one child planted his seed, watered them everyday, did all his best but the grains refused to grow up.
P4	His friends advised him to go to the market and buy corn that he will present to the king so that he can be chosen.
" I can't do that, my parents taught me to be honest ", said the young boy to his friends.
P5	Time and days passed and the ten boys went to the kingdom palace to show their results.
All of them came with some sacks of corn except one child.

- What did you do with the seeds? said the king to the empty handed boy.
- Majesty, I planted and watered them but they didn't grow up, said the young boy.
P6	The king took the young boy and said: the biggest quality that must have a king is honesty. All your grains were boiled that means they can't grow.
Only this boy succeeded and he become my son
