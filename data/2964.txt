P1	Abwo kare omomura narenge ororo orenge korokwa Demane. Nigo abwate esare yambwabo orenge korokwa Demazana. Ekero abaibori babo bakwete nigo bachiete komenya na ise moke. Korende nigo bachandetwe mono. Nigo barenge goitwa nebiranya ebitambe,  naboigo bakaba bakoegwa erongori yoka naende rimo rioka kera rituko. Igo bagatama.
P2	They found a cave to live in. They were scared because they had heard that there were cannibals living in the hills. So they made a strong door to cover the entrance,  with only two holes to let in air and light. Demane warned his sister,  "Stay in the cave while I am out hunting,  and don't cook any meat. Cannibals love the smell of cooking meat."
P3	Each evening Demane brought back something he had killed – a hare or some birds or a small buck. As he came to the cave,  he sang: "Demazane,  Demazane,  Child of my mother,  Open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes."
P4	Demazane akarosa kobera ere bweka ase ekerongo keria kera rituko. Igo rituko erimo,  ekero momura omwabo asogete isiko gochia koinda na gotega emenyama,  agasoka nere korora. Akanyora oroche agasoa ime gochiesa,  na korina emete igoro. Akaigwa buya koba isiko ye'kerongo keria. "Oranyore," banto tibaiyo bakoria abande. Gose onyore buna tata moke nigo arenge gototebia igo erinde tooboe.
P5	Rituko riria riarenge kobwatia akaba omoremu mono gouta omorero erinde anyare koigwa riberera. Gotatiga rende anyuotete ime yekerongo keria omorangu oria gosiekire – erio anyare koba tu ase omorembe. "Ninde nobomaene buna kende tikeiyo kerakorekane ing'ise gosamba akanyama gake igo. Nigo erabe buya koria endagera eiyekire."
P6	When her brother came home he sang as usual,  "Demazane,  Demazane,  Child of my mother,  Open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes." She opened the door and let him in. When he saw the cooked meat,  Demane asked,  "How did you do this without a fire?" "I dried the meat in the sun outside the cave," Demazane replied quickly. Demane was too tired to argue,  and they sat down to enjoy the meal together.
P7	The next day,  she made a fire and cooked meat again. She was just finished when a voice sang outside the door,  "Demazane,  Demazane,  Child of my mother,  Open this cave to me. The swallows can enter it. It has two holes." But the voice did not sound like her brother's. Demazane said: "No. You are not my brother; your voice is not like his." She felt safe in the cave.
P8	Ake igo akaigwa naende omonto kagotera isiko yekerongo keria,  "Tiga insoe mosubati ominto." Ing'igorere omwana ominto. Omwana o mama,  Ing'igorere ekerongo eke. Ebinyoni nabo bigosoa. Naende nigo kebwate chingoro ibere." Eriogi riria nigo riarenge buna eriamomura omwabo,  igo akamoigorera."
P9	Omosacha oyomo omoneene omerete etukia omobere bwensi agaichora ekerongo keria ime. Akamong'usa Demazane atarachi gotama. Demazane akanyaro kobogoria ribu ike. Riria buna abogoirie kogenda,  akanyakoruta ribu riria nchera kogenda.
P10	That day,  all Demane had managed to trap was a hive full of bees – he was carrying them in a thick bag slung over his shoulder. When he came to the cave,  he found the door open and his sister gone but ashes pointing the way into the woods. He followed the ash along the path until he saw a fire in the distance.
P11	Ang'e nomorero oria omosacha omoneene omerete etukia omobere bwensi naikaransete aroro negunia eneene kere ensemo. Demane agatara mbaka as'are kagosogora buna oria oumiete. "Gaki tata one,  nonkonye? Naumiire okogoro kwane. Inkonye amache yokonywa." Omosacha oria akairaneria,  "Nigo indakoretere amache rioka ekero orang'eneki na kong'a oboene buna togokuna gunia yane." akagacha egunia eria buuya nyomba mwaye.
P12	But when he had gone,  Demane cut the string of the bag,  and out climbed his sister. Demane replaced the bag with his own full of bees,  and brother and sister hid and waited to see what would happen.
P13	When the man came with the water,  his son and daughter came with him. He said to his daughter: "There is something nice in the bag in our hut. Go! Bring it!" She opened the bag a little to see what it was,  but the bees stung her hand,  and she called out,  "It is biting." "Go and help her!" he shouted to his son. But the result was the same.
P14	"Don't treat me like a fool",  he shouted,  and stormed into the hut. He closed the door and opened the bag himself. The angry bees swarmed out and stung his head,  his nose,  his eyes. Blinded,  he jumped about,  howling with pain.
P15	Akaminyoka na kogwa nomotwe ime yamache,  omotwe oye okananta ase esike. Agaonchokera omote orenge ang'e naende akanyora nekonu yechinchoke. Korwa abuo ase engaki etambe,  Demane na Demazane bakaria oboke obwansu korwa ase ekonu eria.
