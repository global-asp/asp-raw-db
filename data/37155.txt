P1	Oscar is a little goat. He lives on a farm. He is very brave and adventurous. @@In his herd there are 20 goats, including Oscar.
P2	A herd of 20 cattle live next to the goats. Oscar's best friend is a cow called Shola. @@One day, Oscar and Shola decide to make friendship bracelets. "Let us make a bracelet for everyone," says Shola.@@"The bracelets will be a sign of our friendship," agrees Oscar.
P3	Oscar and Shola divide the work of making bracelets equally. They each make 20 bracelets. @@Each bracelet has 1 piece of red wool and 1 piece of blue wool. How many pieces of red and blue wool did they use altogether?
P4	Everyone loves the friendship bracelets. The 40 friends are happy together. @@Then, suddenly, the cattle disappear! Nobody knows what happened. Only half of the animals remain.@@Oscar decides to search for Shola and the rest of her herd.
P5	Oscar sets off on his journey.@@He comes to a gap in the ground. The gap is too wide to jump over. It is 1 meter wide. @@He finds some branches that he can use as a bridge. The branches are 150 centimeters long.  Will they be long enough?
P6	Oscar lays the branches next to each other, and walks across the gap. @@He is relieved when he reaches the other side! @@He continues to walk and walk. The day is hot and he becomes very thirsty.
P7	Oscar searches for water. He finally sees a river and rushes over to it.@@The rocks are slippery and Oscar slips and slides! He falls onto a big rock just above the water. @@He nearly slips into the river.
P8	There is a huge crocodile in the river below! @@Oscar screams for help. He screams until he sees someone coming. It is a cow. @@The cow shouts, "I will fetch a rope and some friends to help you!"
P9	When the cow returns, she throws a rope and Oscar just manages to catch it. The rope is made of pieces of colourful wool. @@The rope is a little too short. Oscar ties his friendship bracelet to the end of the rope. Now it is long enough.
P10	"Hold on tight and we will pull you up," says the cow. Oscar is soon on the river bank. @@He goes to thank the other cattle and sees his best friend! They are overjoyed and hug each other.@@Oscar has many questions about what happened.
P11	"We wondered away from the farm. We were grazing and a wild dog chased us. We ran for our lives!" says Shola. @@"We ran so fast and so far that we could not find our way back to the farm. We missed you all!" she adds.
P12	Oscar, Shola, and 19 cattle return to the farm.@@The 19 goats are overjoyed and all the friends are reunited.@@They are a group of 40 friends again.
