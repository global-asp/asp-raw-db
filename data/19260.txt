page_text:

P1	Once upon a time Eagle and Hen were best friends. The two of them were together and chatted from morning till dusk. Eagle's chickens couldn't wait to visit Hen's chickens and play with them.
P2	One day Hen approached Eagle. "My friend," she said. "I have to ask you a big favour. Rooster's pyjama pants are torn. He is really grumpy about it. They are his favourite pants. I want to mend the pants,  but I don't have a needle. May I borrow your needle?" Eagle nodded. "Of course,  dear friend," she said. "But please take good care of it. It is an heirloom needle. My grandmother gave it to me." "Of course,  my friend," Hen said. She took the shining needle. "I'll return it tomorrow."
P3	Hen went away to mend her husband's pants. The next morning,  as usual,  Hen was on her way to Eagle. But oh,  goodness – the needle was gone! Hen anxiously called her little chicks together. "Has anyone seen Eagle's needle?" she asked. "No,  Mommy," the chickens cheeped. "Help me look for it," Hen said.
P4	Hen and her chickens looked everywhere. In every bush. Behind every lump of grass. Inside all their nests. But Eagle's needle was gone.
P5	"And where is the needle you borrowed from me?" Eagle asked. "Hen swallowed. "Oh,  Eagle I am so sorry. I lost your needle." "Lost it?" Eagle was angry. "Don't worry," Hen said quickly. "My chickens and I will find it. It must be here somewhere.
P6	Look carefully when you see Hen and her chickens again. Up until this day they are still scratching around in the dust,  looking for Eagle's needle. And when Hen notices an eagle flying in the air,  she anxiously clucks: "Quick,  little chicks. Hide beneath my wings. If Eagle sees you,  she will catch you. She is still annoyed about her grandmother's needle."
