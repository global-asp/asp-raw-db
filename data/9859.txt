page_text:

P1	Everyone should have a village where his or her ancestors came from. I come from Serere district,  in my village,  there are different tribes and these are; Baganda,  Japadhola,  Iteso etc. Baganda like digging while us the Iteso like normadic pastoralism. In those days,  there used to be bad behaved people and I thank the president for setting up a police station in our village. This police station has helped us so much by arresting those bad behaved people. I also thank this police station because it saved my cousin from killers. How did it save her? One day when my cousin was going to the well to fetch water,  as she was almost reaching the well,  she had not noticed that the killers were following her she heard a voice saying that.
P2	"Stop there." Then she saw them with their weapons. She cried so loud that the police heard her. She saw the police officers coming. Then they arrested those killers. That's how she was saved by the police. I now like going to visit my relatives in the village. Whenever I go to the village,  my relatives welcome me warmly and our grandparents tell us interesting stories. THE END.
