page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in a jungle far far away lived a tiger who ran the whole jungle keeping all the animals together. Time passed and he became old. He couldn't even walk without a stick so he decided to ask the animals to choose a new KING!
P2	The animals were happy with their king so they became worried when he told them he could not be their king anymore. So when he asked for anyone who wanted to be the next king no one came forward.
P3	"We don't want a new king" called a little mouse and the other animals around him looked baffled too! @"Why do you want to leave" asked the elephant.@"The king should be able to protect his people and I can barely walk" said the old King.
P4	When no one came forward the king decided to have a Javeline throw match to choose a new king. All the animals were still confused....
P5	Reluctantly the elephant took the first attempt but tripped because of his weight. He did not manage to throw it far....
P6	Than came the monkey and he jumped and he ran and his throw covered a huge span...
P7	No one else wanted to participate but a goat came forward and the animals laughed. "How can you manage to throw it far?" @@But the goat decided to give it a try...
P8	Determined she looked and the king asked the animals to not belittle her...
P9	The animals looked on while the goat ran and ran and ran hard and threw the javeline far... the animals were amazed at her courage and grin for she did not look like someone who could win...
P10	So the king took her hand and declared her the king. For she had a strong heart and a will of steel. The animals cheered her and all hailed the King.
