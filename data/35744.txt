P1	This chair may look old or awful, but if it could speak, it will comfort many souls. It could heal broken hearts. It could comfort those who are deeply hurt. And it could also uplift many depressed souls.
P2	It was on this chair when I was told that I'm not alone. It was on this chair when I was told that I'm beautiful, inside out. It was on this chair when I was asked if I believe that I'm the most beautiful creature this world has ever seen.
P3	It was on this chair when I was comforted when I was down through no fault of mine. It was on this chair when I was told that I have a heartwarming smile. It was on this chair when I was told that I have an uplifting laughter.
P4	It was on this chair when I was asked if I'm aware that my laughter has healed many broken and shattered hearts.@It is only if this chair could speak that it could tell the universe how I was made to feel.
P5	If this chair could speak, it will reveal the unrevealed. It was on this chair when I was made to feel that I matter and that I am wanted. It is only this chair that knows how important I was made to feel.
P6	This chair heard my pleasurable screams and it felt my true feelings when I was made to feel like I'm living in the world of my own. This chair felt my hot sweat when my heart was beating faster because I was told that I smell like daisies.
P7	This chair heard the soft voice that whispered near my ears like a morning breeze that my scent makes a heart go weak and melt.
P8	Only and only if this chair could speak, it will unearth my true feelings. But some feelings run so deep that they are better left unrevealed.
