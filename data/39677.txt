P2	They both loved playing football.They played for their village team which went by the name Giantune Strikers.The Team comprised of both boys and girls.
P3	Every day after school and during the weekend, they went to practice playing with their coach whose name was Jane. She was also their English teacher.
P4	One day the coach bought the team new uniform as they were going for a tournament with a team from the neighbouring village.The team members were elated and promised to win the match.
P5	After the tournament they all went home very happy because they had won the match just like they had promised their coach.
P6	Their coach rewarded the team by taking them to Amboseli National Park the following weekend. They left very early in their school bus. They were very excited about it.
P7	When they alighted, the tour guide took them around the park and the first animals they saw was a dazzle of zebras running towards the river to quench their thirst.
P8	As they proceeded near the river, they came across various kinds of animals such as elephant, giraffe, buffalos and lion. They also saw various species of birds like flamingoes and kingfishers.
P9	It was a great day and indeed they had a lot of fun. On their way back home they promised their coach to concentrate seriously on their training so that they could win the County cup of pupils under sixteen years.
