P1	Once upon a time there is a dying civilized kingdom named Atlantis located at the top of  Mount Visuvius found in the Deva island at the middle of the Bermuda triangle; a dangerous part of the pacific ocean.
P2	The great king Callisto is dying because of the Riptide Virus spreading across the kingdom. For the sake of the kingdom's life, the great king decided to choose who will gonna lead the kingdom if his life ends.
P3	The king has four sons. Prince Jon is older among the four and has talent in music. The second is Prince Kinneth who embodies intelligence in kinesthetics. Third is prince Vince who is known for his prowess in different defense techniques.
P4	Lastly and the youngest is Prince Dexter who is known for nothing. He usually get bullied by his older brothers because they think that he is useless and unworthy. On their core, the four princes dreams to lead the whole kingdom someday.
P5	One day , King Callisto asked the four princes to meet him in the grand hall of the palace. "Good day my beloved sons. As you all know, I am dying and I have to choose one of you who shall inherit this responsibility," the king open up.
P6	"I know all of you wants  to lead Atlantis, but we only have one throne and I have to choose only one," the king continue. "How will you know whose gonna be the one?" Prince Jon asked with confusion. Are we going to fight?" said Kinneth.
P7	"Fighting will never be an option. A real king must know who he is; his capabilities, personality, characteristics and everything about him, because this will serve as his armor in battling different forms of downfall," the king said.
P8	"So what are we going to do?" Prince Vince asked straightly. King Callisto answered " Know thyself and tell me why do you deserve my throne." The king gave them six days to explore deeply to themselves and realized how deserving they are.
P9	"What a poor prince," Jon told to Dexter. "How can you lead the kingdom if you have nothing," Jon added. "Brother, I gues you don't deserve the crown," Kinneth said. "This game of throne circles among us," Vince said and leave
P10	Prince Dexter is overthinking at the wide garden at the back of the palace. "I want the throne to be mine, but how can I humbly get it if I don't have any capabilities. I don't even know who I am and my purpose," the prince said with guilt.
P11	After a moment he walk into the palace but he stops when he saw a beautiful lady floating in the array of flowers. "Who are you?" He shockingly asked. "I am Flora the goddess of flowers," the lady said and flaunted her beauty.
P12	"I know you problem and I know how to solve that problem," Flora added. "Tell me what should I do your kindness," the prince humbly reply. "You don't fully know who you are and you want to become the king the Atlantis isn't it?" Flora said.
P13	"That exactly what my problem is," the prince cleared things out. If you really want to know who you are in easiest way as possible, I think the six enchanting mirror will help you," said Flora. "Six enchanting mirror?" The prince asked.
P14	"Just by seeing your reflection in every mirror, you can see who you are in different aspects," Flora finely said. "That's awesome, where can I get those enchanting mirror?" The prince asked.
P15	"The god of all gods and goddesses gave those mirrors to six different kingdoms of the world, and one of it can be found from your father. If I were you I will first take the other five mirrors because it's far from here" Flora finely said.
P16	The prince thanks the godess and immediately leave. He pack foods, water and a gold bar from his dead mother. Amidst his preparation, the three prince enter his room and degrade him. He is used to it so he just take it away.
P17	When clock strikes 12 in the morning, Prince Dexter leave the kingdom to start his venture. He is heading first to Avalon kingdom at the far east of Atlantis located at the top of the mountain ranges.
P18	When he gets there, soldier handcuffed him and bring him to the king of Avalon. "Who are you?" The king asked. "I am Dexter and I am here for the enchanting mirror," the prince said. I don't allow anyone to see without in return," king said
P19	The prince stops for a moment and the gold bar came to his mind. "Take this," he said to the king while handing the gold. The king smile and lead the prince to a room where one of the enchanting mirror hides.
P20	"It is the physical mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are physically," king humbly said. The prince move in front of the mirror and saw him with an average height, fair skin, average nose and endomorph type of body.
P21	On the second day of his venture, he trailed to Terra Nova kingdom located at the far west of Atlantis near Nazi river. Before he step to the kingdom, he first fought wild animals while he is in his way to the kingdom.
P22	When he gets there, people were eyeing him to death. He asked one of the soldier as to where is the king of Terra Nova. The soldier lead the prince inside the kingdom and introduce him to the king. "What broughts you here?" the king asked.
P23	"Your highness, I am here to see myself on the enchanting mirror," Prince Dexter straightly said. "Your wish will be granted if you offer something in the palace," king replied. "Take this gold in exchange of it," the prince humbly said.
P24	"Wish granted," the king shortly said. They go to a room where the mirror hides. "It is the sexual mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are sexually," the king said with amusement. The prince step to the mirror.
P25	What he saw is man embodies uniqueness. He is physically and sexually attracted to same sex. His true color comes out and that gives him clearance towards his sexual self.
P26	The third day of his venture is all about Castiglione Kingdom. This kingdom is at the far north of Atlantis in front of the pacific ocean. While on its way, he fought again to wild animals in the forest.
P27	When he reach his destination, he was overwhelmed because people were hospitable. A soldier lead him to the king of Castiglione and introduce him. The prince told his reason to the king why he is in this kingdom and also offer the gold bar.
P28	The king of Castiglione didn't hesitate to let the prince see his reflection in the mirror. "It is the material mirror, see you reflection and you'll find out who you are materially," the king said. The prince step to the mirror.
P29	The prince saw his self in the mirror giving importance to those things in need over things that he want. That is his material self.
P30	The next kingdom was not as tough, he easily get to the south of Atlantis where the kingdom of Devonshire is rooted near a falls. He has three gold bars left and he gave one to the king of Devonshire as an exchange to see his reflection.
P31	"It is the spiritual mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are spiritually," king said. Prince saw a man full faith to his god. He fears sins, hurting people, and hating people. He is a good follower of his religion.
P32	The next kingdom is the kingdom of Syldavia. This kingdom is the most civilized kingdom of all kingdoms of the world. It is located at the far south east of Atlantis. The prince faced hardship getting there because a thunderstorm hits.
P33	After the storm, he continue his journey and finally reach the kingdom  of Syldavia. A soldier welcomed him and leads directly to the king. While on its way  he saw how civilized the kingdom is. Technology is more advance here.
P34	When they already meet the king, he straightly said about his purpose of his venture. He also gave the gold bar to the king as an exchange. The king didn't hesitate to grant the prince's request so they trail to the mirror.
P35	"It is the digital mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are digitally," the king said. The prince saw his self inside a digital device where in he's totally different from what and who he is in the physical world.
P36	He saw a Dexter that is very conscious on appearance in the digital world. Generally, it only refers to his digital self.
P37	Five kingdoms were down, one kingdom has left. Tomorrow is the final day of the alloted time for the exploration of self. Prince Dexter gradually penetrate all the knowledge he learned and he is slowly building his self identity.
P38	On the sixth day, Prince Dexter trail the way back to Atlantis kingdom bearing all the knowledge he acquired throughout his venture. When he reach the kingdom he was confused because many people are gathering at the grand hall of the palace
P39	He saw his father and his three brothers at the center. "Where have you been my brother?" Prince Jon smirk. "Finding his worth maybe," Prince Vince answered sarcastically. "Or maybe crying far away," Prince Kinneth seconded the motion.
P40	"Good day Atlantis," King Callisto open. "Today we'll witness who's gonna be the next successor of my crown. The princes were tasked to know their selves and I gave them six days," he added. Everbody in the kingdom are excited and happy.
P41	"It's time to show what they've got for that period of search about their selves," the king said.The three prince are relaxed while Prince Dexter is obviously nervous. But he stick to his core and believe in himself.
P42	Prince Jon made the first step. "As you all know, I am good in music. This talent had help me to discover more about me because it is in music where I can feel the inner me. I deserved to be your king because I am the oldest and strongest."
P43	Prince Kinneth speak up. "In the six days of my exploration, I realized that kinesthetic intelligence defines who I am. I will use this ability to lead and make the entire kingdom shine over the stars in the sky. I am brave and intelligent.
P44	Prince Vince delivered his speech. "I am known for my prowess in self defense technique. That is who I am. I will use this skill to protect the entire kingdom from enemy. I am brave and I think that's enough for me to be your next king.
P45	Prince Dexter step to the center and started delivering his speech. "I am known for nothing. But it doesn't mean I'm totally nothing," he opened up. "That views of others to me drives me to search my self and find my worth," he added.
P46	"I was used to be nothing for a long time. I realized that I shouldn't be like that forever. That's why I travel and search for myself  because I don't want to be useless forever. I want to be a king, but how can I, if I am nothing."
P47	"Knowing myself gives me idea about my capabilities, personality, and flaws too. As I go through to my venture, I slowly accept who I am and I gradually build a self identity. It's amazing to know who you are."
P48	"In the six days of my journey, I can say that all the things I've learned about myself are much enough to make me the next king of this kingdom. I am not the prince who use to be call by everyone as nothing, rather I'm the prince of hope."
P49	"Being brave and talented is not enough, what's more enough is that you fully know who you are, your strength and your weaknesses. I may not be the most talented, but I assure to all of you, I am the finest king that you'll ever have."
P50	"I deserve to be the next king of Atlantis, because I know who I am, my purpose, my intention and most of all my core as a leader," Prince Dexter seriously said. Everybody in the palace were amazed about what the prince said.
P51	"We here all what they done in span of six days but we will not only base our judgement on their self exploration," the king said. The four princes were confused because they don't know what's going next.
P52	"To refinely choose who is the most deserving, we will need this object," the king said while pointing an unknown object covered by a wide white cloth. "What's that father?" Prince Vince asked. "It is the political mirror," king replied.
P53	"The sixth enchanting mirror!" Prince Dexter whisper with amusement. "It is one of the six enchanting mirror given by the god of all gods and godesses. This will help us to determine who among of you deserves my throne," King Callisto said.
P54	"Let's start the judgement," king give signal. First to see his reflection is Prince Jon. He step to the mirror and see his political self. "This is the political mirror, see your refelection and you'll find out who you are polititically."
P55	Prince Jon saw him in the mirror as a corrupt leader and everybody in the palace were shocked on what they have seen. It only means that he don't deserve the throne because he'll just put the Atlantis out of luck.
P56	Prince Kinneth is next and he move to the front of the mirror. "This is the political mirror, see your reflection and you'll see who you are politically," the king delivered. Prince Kinneth was shocked when he saw his self as a thief.
P57	Everybody in the palace was shocked too because they don't expect it at all. Prince Vince step up to the mirror. "It is the political mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are politically," king said.
P58	The prince was shocked because he saw his self prostituting a lot of women in the kingdom. Everybody can't believe what they saw including his father. This is not their expectation and that gives them a quake in their mind.
P59	When Prince Dexter step to the front of the mirror, he feels tension because he might not see a good reflection of his political self. But he believes in himself so he continue stepping towards the enchanting mirror.
P60	"This is the political mirror, see your reflection and you'll find out who you are politically," the mirror shines and the people were amazed of they see. Prince Dexter saw his self in the mirror as a good leader of Atlantis.
P61	"The mirror has spoken, the chosen one is no other than Prince Dexter," king said. Everyone give a big applause while Dexter was shocked and he hug his dying father; King of Atlantis. His three brothers left the hall and feel shame.
P62	After Prince Dexter was crown, he immediately respond his duty and became a good leader of Atlantis. His father died with no worry and his three brothers gradually accept the fact that he is way more deserving than them.
P63	Years have past, the kingdom of Atlantis became more civilized under the lead of King Dexter. No hunger, no drought, no poor, everyone is equal regardless of the look, gender, religion, and etc.
P64	"Knowing who you are helps you reach your dream. If you feel you are out of yourself, try to find it and don't let other hinders your search of self. A true leader knows who he is, his strenghts and weaknesses," King Dexter of Atlantis.
