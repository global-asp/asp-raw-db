page_text:

P1	Nana was born in Lusaka,Zambia on the 25th of September 1995. When Nana was 1 year old her Father passed away living her behind with her Mother and her two brothers and one sister.
P2	When Nana’s father passed away her family lost their business and so they had no income to take care of their needs. Nana’s mother one day decided that maybe she could go to her sister in South Africa to look for work.
P3	So when Nana was 5 years old, she and her mother left for South Africa. When Nana arrived in South Africa everything felt normal and looked just like back home in Zambia, but what she did not realise was the big change waiting for her.
P4	Nana had a big shock when she realised that the children here spoke a different language compared to hers. This was the beginning of a whole new life change that was bigger than her wildest imagination, and so the journey began.
