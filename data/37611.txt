page_text:

P1	It was just another boring day until the littlest bunny said to the chicken "Quick come with me look what I have found. "Ok lead the way" said the chicken.
P2	"Arrrah!" screamed the chicken. The bunny was afraid. The dog ran to them and said "What's wrong I heard chicken scream. The dog looked where the chicken and bunny was. "Arrrah!" shouted the dog. "RUN!" Shouted the bunny.
P3	And so they ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran. They ran past the barn. They ran past the pigs. And ran and ran and ran.
P4	They reached the horses and said "Quick run." The horse asked "Why?" The chicken said "We'll tell you when we are safe." "Ok" said the horse.
P5	Then together they ran again. Past the farmers house past the fields. "We should tell the donkey," said the dog. So they ran to the donkeys house.
P6	"Mr Donkey Mr Donkey quick come with us!" shouted the horse. "Ok ok let me just..." Replied the donkey. "No time let's go!" Said the bunny as he dragged the donkey.
P7	The old slow donkey trailed behind them trying to keep up. "What are we running from?" said the horse. "You would freak out if I told you!" said the bunny. The continued to run until they found a place to stay. The old barn.
P8	Safe inside the barn the animals sat down but stayed together. "What was it chicken?" asked the donkey. The chicken was about to answer when they heard a sound suddenly the cow appeared. "Why are you all afraid?" asked the cow. "We saw...
P9	"... A MOUSE! @"What!"@"Was that it?@"Seriously!"@"Sorry we were just afraid," said the bunny. "That's ok it's ok to be afraid," said the cow. @THE END
