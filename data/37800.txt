page_text:

P1	Everyday mom puts the fruits and vegetables in lunchbox but I only eat the fruit.
P2	One day she told me if I don't eat vegetables I won't grow strong and healthy. She also told me there are children who grow hungry every day.
P3	I told my mother I did not want to waste my food anymore so mother said l should tell her all my favourite vegetables. I told her that I still hate vegetables.
P4	One day she bought seeds from the market. She asked me to help her with planting the seeds.
P5	One day I saw that the plant now had a lot of colours. I saw red tomatoes, orange carrots and green spinach.Mother said that we should harvest them.
P6	I said yes and we planted and watered the seeds. Every morning we water the plants so they can grow. It was very fun.
P7	We worked really hard to take care of the vegetables. My mother chopped some of the vegetables and made some stew.
P8	I tried to eat vegetables in the stew. I found out that it was really yummy.
P9	From that day I started eating vegetables and planting them too.
P10	My tummy grumbled and the stew smelled really yummy. Mother poured some stew for me and told me it was from the vegetables we worked hard for.
