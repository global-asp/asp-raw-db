P1	Mu lugudo, bageene omuhasi omuhayire owa baheejaho n'emooni embi.''so swalaho ohuleeha omwana wuwo gagenda mu mumwi ogwohya, ewe ni wererire hu gaali olwaga aƞo?'' As they walked down the road,  they met a woman who looked at them with a bad face. '' Are you not ashamed '' she called to the father to let your little boy walk in the hot sun,  when he should be riding on the bicycle?''.
P2	Mu mooni eyo bageene omusaaja owundi. Owabaheejaho n'etiima,  Oleeha otye omwana wuwo ohugenda mwifuhe eryo lyosi? ''nga ewe weyihalira eyo ƞa mugulu ni hitahuhina ho na kaadi? Further on they met another man,  who looked at them angrily ''how can you let your child walk in the dusty road?'' he asked.'' And you sit up there by yourself''.
P3	Omusaaja gemeresa egaali nga adunda omusaani amutaho nga beyongerayo. The father stopped and lifted his son on the bicycle. So they went on.
P4	Olufanyuma lw'ahateƞama hatotono bageene omusaaja omuhayiire. Gahayuhiiye ahaseere. Nahaloma ati,  "Ewe haseere ewe,  oleha otye lataabo omuhayire ohugenda ewe ni weyagalira hu gaali? After a little while they met an old man. He begun at once to shout at the boy. '' you ungrateful son'' he shouted ''you let your poor old father walk while you ride freely on a bicycle''."
P5	Omusaaja ono ni gabita ƞa bbabba wa haana gahaninusa hu gaali nindi nga omwene aninaho. When the old man had passed the father took his frightened son from the bicycle and got on it himself instead.
P6	Omusaaja bya muheheye nga nindi aninuha anaƞa ahasani ahata mu mega g'egaali. The father was troubled but he reached down and lifted his son up where he could sit on the bicycle infront of him.
P7	Ɲatono olufanyuma,  nindi baganene n'omusaaja n'omuhasi wuwe,  hiisi muutu naali hufuga ahagaali ahahe. Omusaaja geyaasa ''Ewe hisaaja ewe! Oƞanga otye ohugegesa ahanacangala haho omugugu ogwaga aƞo? Busito? Ninuha mangu oli muutu muhulu bugaali weene ohuƞega egaali mu hifo hy'egaali ohubagega enywe abanse'' A little later they met a man and his wife each of the riding a bicycle. The man called out '' you conel man! How can you let the poor bicycle carry such a heavy loaf? Get off at once you are big enough to carry the bicycles instead making it carry the two of you''.
P8	Omusaja wa namweene gadindibaye. Ganinuha hu gaali era ganinusa n'omusani yeesi'' The poor man was far more confused. He got off the bicycle and took his son off too.
P9	Gateema olusaga lw'omusala nga afuna omuguulo ogu gaboƞa hu mipiira je gaali jombi. Nga bagenda batiina ni bagegire egaali ƞagati wawe. He then he cut down a tree branch for a pole. He tied the front and hind wheels of the bicycle on the pole. They walked along,  carrying the bicycle between them.
P10	Ko baba bambula olutindo mwala,  nga baganana n'abosuho ababajehereye era baba hubbirira oluhero. Hyekabi embi ahaseere obuti bwa haῃamba nga hatagala hagwa mu lwabi,  ehiraῃi ti olwabi si lwali luleeƞi. As they were crossing a bridge over a wide stream,  they met with a crowd of young men who immediately started laughing and shouting at them. This noise frightened the young boy and he stumbled into the stream. Luckily it was not very deep.
P11	Omusaaja gaheeja mu lwabi n'obunakuƞafu ko n'agesyaho ohutuusayo omusaani. Ni gamutusa mu lwabi, ganyenya omutwe '' mwana wange '' atyo pogalomanaye omusaani '' so ƞanga husangasa hiisi muutu'' The man looked very sadly into the stream as he tried had to pull out his son. When atleast he got him out he shook his head. '' my son'' he said to him'' You cannot please everybody''.
