page_text:

P1	What true friends are@. They don't lie to u@. They are always happy to see u@. They don't talk bad about u when u are not around@ . They love and respect u
P2	When friends say mean stuff about u they are still ur friends because we all need to go through a bumpy road before we actually go on one.
P3	Like wise people say never judge a book by it's cover , but if u have already read the book and u don't like it give it to someone else and stop wasting time on reading it
P4	Friends are like a closed book if ur lucky enough to open the book then u have to open up ur book and just be an open book who shares things that upsets u with the people u trust
P5	This is what people should think about their friends if they are true friends
