P1	Some of the Debre Birhan University staff live in the four university condominiums located opposite the university. @In their free time, their children play together in the field between the buildings. Today, they meet to choose a game.
P2	They decide to play the Ethiopian Hide and Seek. They like it because they run around as they play it. @They agree that Bama will be the one who seeks.
P3	Bama closes his eyes as others hide. Where he stands is called the Holy Arc. A wood stands there. @Bama counts, “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.” The rule is he keeps his eyes closed until he finishes counting.
P4	Bama finishes counting and cries like a cock. Then the other kids respond, “It is not dawn yet!” After a few times they say, “It is dawn!”@He goes and searches for the others from their hideouts. He sees Robera!
P5	When Bama sees Robera running, he starts fast back to the Holy Arc and kisses the standing wood. Bama wins and Robera loses. As a winner Bama can be a saviour. Therefore he saves one boy, Mikiyas, from being the next seeker.
P6	The other children keep hiding so that Bama and Mikiyas do not see them. They are determined to stay hiding ready to run immediately and kiss the Holy Arc or wood. @Abrham runs without being seen and kisses the wood. He becomes the winner.
P7	Bama and Mikiyas agree that Barok is wrong and so he is out of the game. The two go off to find the rest of the children from their hide-outs.@Two of the children who are the same age and are hiding in the same place, change their clothes.
P8	Thinking that the two kids have already been discovered, Tedi is confused. He is forced to say, “Lepira,” meaning, he has lost and so he will be closing his eyes to start seeking again. @ The first round is over! A few more rounds follow.
