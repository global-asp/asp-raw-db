page_text:

P1	Once a upon a time a fox was eating a lot of goats from families who were pastolarists living in the forest. The fox was timing when people were asleep and other times when they were being grazed inside the bushy areas.
P2	One day the families organized a meeting so that they could find a solution to their problems. The meeting was attended by many families and they selected a leader. After a long discussion they agreed to trap the fox.
P3	After a few days the fox went to eat the goats. It fell into the trap. It was tied to a trunk of a tree in order to be punished. The people dug a big hole and filled it with firewood. They light fire and throw  the fox inside.
P4	People lit the fire and left it burning and decided to return when it had become hot enough to easily burn the fox. The people were so annoyed with the fox because of eating their goats which was their only wealth.
P5	The fox feared the fire and started crying loudly. A Hyena which was very hungry  heard the cry of the fox and thought it had made a catch. It started moving towards the direction where the fox was tied.
P6	Hyena found the fox tied to the tree. It was surprised and asked,"Ooh fox who tied you the tree?" Fox replied, "My uncle". Hyena asked," For what reason?". Fox replied that his uncle saw he was very thin and wanted to slaughter a far sheep.
P7	The  fox lied "The sheep is to be cooked for me in this fire but I will not eat because I am not hungry. For the last few days I have been eating meat and I fear that my stomach will be sick. This is why he has tied me, to make sure I eat"
P8	The Hyena laughed, "Heee heee!, I will untie you from the tree and instead tie me to the tree. I am very hungry. I will eat the sheep and you will be set free". The hyena  said, "I will be very thankful to you because I am dying of hunger".
P9	The Hyena agreed and when the people returned to throw the fox into the fire they didn't find it. They found hyena tied to the tree. They were surprised and asked the Hyena, " Oh hyena, where is the fox?". The Hyena replied ,"I untied him"
P10	People asked, " Why did you do that?" Hyena replied," The fox told me that he was not feeling hungry and therefore I could eat the meat that was being prepared for him". The people shouted, " What!, Which meat!". All of them were shocked!
P11	The people were so angry at the foolishness of the hyena who saved the fox. They decided to throw him into the fire. This is how the greedy and foolish hyena died.
