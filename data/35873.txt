P7	But Luz Viminda and her elder sister Vhia are so close to each other. They loved to buy clothes and shoes that have the same color and style. Sometimes people think that they are twins, although they have five years gap. It's not noticeable
P8	Luz Viminda and her sister have a little similarity in character or personality. They both just want to stay at home and they attend to their small business in down town which is the barbeque stick. Also they are both a female
P9	But they can do anythin that males or men can do. And they amazed their neighbors for that character. Every time the neighbors saw them carrying a sack of barbeque stick they always say to her mother " you are lucky to have your children."
P10	Because their children act like a well grown lady, they are shy whenever their parents want them to carry something. Unlike the two who doesnt care what other people would say. They are not a type of teenagers who prioretized  lovelife.

P13	She even used Vice Ganda's image as a profile picture in her facebook account. She posts about vice ganda and subscribe to every channel of her idol. She always wanted to watch tv just to see her idols face.
P14	Then she gave her full attention in her studies, in grade 9 she run as a SSG vice president for the whole campus. but she did not won. From that time she taste the bitterness of losing. She cried the whole night, and her sister was there.
P15	But her mother told her to stop idolizing him. And just put your full attention to her studies. And she did what she told. She started to avoid watching tv because it will just tempt her. stop the notification in my social media accounts.
P16	On the next year, she is a grade 10 student the COMELEC told her again to run but she dont want to be a losser again. But something is telling her that she wanted too. So she ask an advice to her sister and her sister told her an advice.
P17	To follow what she really wanted. And then she run as a president, campaign arrived and next is the debate. And the candedate both did well. Luz Viminda won. She became an SSG president for the year (2018-2019). Her time to lead has come.
