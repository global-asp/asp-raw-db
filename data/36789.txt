page_text:

P1	Once upon a time not so long ago, there was a little honey badger called Harold. He lived in Africa in the middle of the Kgalagadi Nature Reserve. On the rocky side of the nature reserve there was also a lion called Tau.
P2	Every day Harold would help his mom find food for their family. Tau and Harold were best friends because they both went to the same bush school where they would learn how to survive in the nature reserve. Tau would sit, let tourists take pictures of him and give him food.
P3	Tau wanted to be known as the most popular animal in the reserve, even when his teachers told him to stay away from tourists. One day when Harold was helping his mom, Tau forced Harold to pretend to be chased by him. Tau also said, "Come on Harold, we'll be in the picture of the year and then we'll be famous!"
P4	Harold was under pressure and had a bad gut feeling, but he wanted to please his friend Tau. As they did it, there was a game ranger with A BUS OF TOURISTS AROUND THE CORNER!! Everyone saw Harold go underneath the bus of tourists and everyone started to get really worried. Tau was terrified, because he thought that he lost his best friend forever.
P5	Luckily, Harold listened to his teachers at the bush school, curled up into a ball and rolled out the other side of the road. After that Harold learned that he must always listen to his gut and say no when he doesn't want to do anything he doesn't feel comfortable with. As for Tau, he learned that it is more important to have friends than being popular.
