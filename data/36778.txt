P1	I once was in the woods camping for the night with my friends we decided to go get some wood for a campfire do thats when I heard a siren noise coming from the distance like  1m away from me. I stood with confusion wondering what it was.
P2	So I just carried on trying to find wood as soon as I did that I hear the same noise again coming closer and closer to me I was petrified I couldn't move for some weird reason it was so close that I could see the thing coming it had.
P3	Two sirens and a thin body it was standing right in front of me so I ran for my life it was chasing me!!! I ran for my life until I was out of breath
