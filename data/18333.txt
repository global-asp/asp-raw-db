P4	The next day,  the ox said to the donkey,  "I did not have any rest."
P5	The donkey replied,   "I went to the market today. I worked harder than you."
P6	The next day,  again the ox said,  "Today was a very bad day for me."
P7	The donkey told the ox,  "When the farmer comes,  lie down and say,  'Moo! Moo!' He will let you rest."
P8	The next morning,  the ox cried,  "Moo! Moo!" The farmer let him rest.
P9	The farmer took the donkey out to plough the land.
P10	The donkey worked hard all day. In the evening,  he was very tired.

P12	The ox said,  "I will work tomorrow. I feel better now."
