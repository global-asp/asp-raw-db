desc:	A story about a baby girl called Melokuhle and her four-year-old brother Asante

page_text:

P1	Melokuhle was born in a small, diverse rural township in South Africa. @@South Africans speak many different languages, like isiXhosa, Sesotho, isiZulu, Shona, English and Afrikaans â€“ even in one household. @@Melokuhle's mother speaks isiXhosa and her father speaks Sesotho. Her father lives and works in a city far away.@@Melokuhle's mother works in a shop owner's house in town. She has a firstborn child called Anathi, who is 15 years old, and two young children. Asante is four years old, and Melokuhle is six months old.
P2	It is early in the morning and it is still dark and cold outside. Anathi steps onto the misty street and pulls the shawl close around her neck. @@Melokuhle is warm and cosy against the wind, wrapped in a blanket and sleeping on her sister's back. Asante walks next to them, holding Anathi's hand.
P3	Anathi is taking Melokuhle and Asante to the play centre down the road. As she walks, Anathi sings a song.@@Melokuhle and Asante are the first to arrive at Iindumiso Centre. @@Nolulamo runs this play centre for children from birth to four years old. The centre is a small four-roomed house. @@Inside the play centre it is warm, heated up by the stove on which porridge is cooking.
P4	Anathi greets Nolulamo in Sesotho, "Dumela Mme." @@Nolu responds in isiXhosa, "Mholweni, Anathi" and to Asante, "Mholo, Sante. Unjani namhlanje?" Asante replies but he is shy, "Philile."@@Nolu tries to get Asante's attention, "Ungxamelephi na awandihoya?" He replies, "Qhuba imoto," and goes off by himself to the car toys.
P5	Nolu takes Melokuhle gently from her older sister's back and lays her on the mattress in the next room for babies.
P6	Meanwhile, Asante plays with cars on the road mat until the other children arrive.
P7	Melokuhle wakes up and Nolu changes her nappy.@@"Melo, Melo! Ubonwabele ubuthongo bakho. You enjoyed your sleep, neh?" She smiles at Melokuhle.@@Nolu laughs and shakes her head. Melokuhle copies Nolu, shaking her head and giggling.
P8	Nolu speaks to Melokuhle, "Masitshintshe ke ngoku," making eye contact. "Kufuneka sicoceke, sinuke kamnandi, xa sizakutya." She wants Melo to be clean and to smell nice when she eats.@@While Nolu clears the change area Melokuhle looks at other objects around her and talks to herself quietly. "Ta, ta,' she says.@@"Thatha," says Nolu, giving Melo a soft toy which she grabs and chews.
P9	Melo's attention turns to the bright sunlight coming through the window. She is staring at the sunrays.@@Nolu tells Melo it is time for breakfast. "Lixesha lesidlo sakusasa, Melo," says Nolu. "Yum, yum, yum."@@When the food is finished, Nolu shows Melo the empty bowl and says, "Mmmmh, phelile!" Melo replies, "Mmmmh."
P10	Nolu settles Melokuhle on a blanket on the floor, next to two other babies. She puts a variety of toys in front of them. @@She shakes a soft ball in front of Melo's eyes and says, "Hlukuhla, hlukuhla, hlukuhla ibhola. Jonga, Melo." She shakes the ball from side to side. Melo watches the ball carefully.@@Nolu names each toy for Melo and watches while she plays.
P11	Asante's age group had breakfast too. Now they are playing in different areas. @@Asante has finished playing with cars. He decides to show his baby sister his baby doll. @@He finds Melo in the baby room, lying on the blanket on her tummy, after her nap. "Melo," he says, giving her the doll, "Yeyakho."@@Melo tries to hold the doll but it falls. She grabs the doll's leg and tries to put it in her mouth.
P12	"Asante, mkhulu kakhulu unodoli kuMelo," Nolu tells Asante that the doll is too big for Melo.@@Nolu takes the doll and tells Melo not to eat it. She says, "Melo, sukutya unodoli." She replaces the doll with a soft rubber toy.  @@She gives the doll to Asante and says, "Uyathanda ukwabelana nosisi wakho omncinci." She praises Asante for sharing with his baby sister. "Ewe," replies Asante.
P13	Nolu asks Asante to go and play with his friends. "Hamba uyodlala nezihlobo zakho."@@"Ndihlala noMelo," Asante replies. "Melo yahleka," he says.@@"Yes," says Nolu. "Melo yahleka." She asks Asante to come and see Melo later. "Ungabuya uzokumbona ngelinye ixesha?" Asante smiles, "Ewe." He goes to the playroom@@Teacher Sara has prepared the learning environment in the small playroom
P14	Asante and the other children are busy playing. They take turns to do different activities, chatting to each other.@@Asante loves playing with the blocks, stacking them as high as he can until they fall down. @@When they fall Lebo says in Sesotho, "A re etse hape, ibedelele jwalo kasifate!" Asante laughs. "Ewe, ibende njengomthi," he agrees in isiXhosa. They build another tower as tall as a tree.
P15	Xolani and Cynthia always play together, sorting the bottle tops and putting them into colourful piles. . @@Xolani says, "Eziluhlaza kunye, ezibomvu kunye, ezilubhelu kunye."@@"Blue, red, and yellow," says Cynthia.@@Nomsa and Tumelo are drawing at the table talking to each other about what they are drawing.@@It is nearly time for the children to rest. They help Teacher Sara to put the toys away on the shelves. Then they sit in a circle on the floor next to Teacher Sara.
P16	While Teacher Sara reads, she shows the pictures to the children. She listens to the children when they talk about the story.@@Nolu knows that Melo also likes to listen to stories. Nolu sits on her chair next to Asante. @@Melo sits with Asante. The brother and sister are happy together, listening to the story.
