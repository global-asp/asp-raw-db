page_text:

P1	My house is old, but it is new for me.
P2	There is a path to the front door.
P3	It also has a steep roof.
P4	There is a dam in the garden.
P5	And a forest of trees near the dam.
P6	I can see a big mountain in the distance.
P7	When I sleep my house grows tall.
P8	When I wake up it goes small
P9	What is my new house really?
P10	Can you guess?
P11	Good night! Sleep tight!
