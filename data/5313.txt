page_text:

P1	Once there was a butterfly named Fiffie. She was clever at working with computers.
P2	Fiffie saw a girl who was upset and sad. The girl saw a nasty picture on a website.
P3	Fiffie flew over to the girl's house.
P4	She said to the girl,  "Never go on the internet without a grownup."
P5	The girl and Fiffie became friends. Fiffie went to live with the girl.
P6	When the girl grew up she opened her own computer shop. Every week she had lessons to teach children how to work on computers.
P7	She taught the children never to go on websites without the permission of grownups. Because of Fiffie,  the woman never had naughty fingers again!
