page_text:

P1	The children wake up early and help each other to get prepared for school so that they are not late.
P2	They then walk together to school as it is better to help one another in case one gets injured on the way. It is nice to walk together.
P3	They play together at break time and make new friends who are good.
P4	When they return home, they help their parents with house chores to finish quickly.
P5	They eat their dinner after they have prayed for the meal as a family. They talk to their parents about school and what the teacher taught.
P6	They do not forget to pray, because a family that prays together, stays together.
