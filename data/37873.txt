page_text:

P1	We were happily swimming in the swimming pool. We were happily having  fun while swimming. Everyone was laughing  and all I could hear was their voices. I was also happy as a king in his kingdom. The water at the pool was warm.
P2	After swimming, my brother and I went to read a storybook outside our house. Suddenly a handsome man came and asked my brother and I to help him find his home. Our parents taught us to always help a person in need. We decided to help him.
P3	We started out journey to the man's house. We crossed roads and finally, we were at the man's house. It looked  bad and scary.
P4	He welcomed us and told us to fell at home. He also made us some coffee to drink. As we were drinking coffee we saw something strange on him. He had two mouths which we did not see as we were going to to his home. He wanted to killu us.
P5	Just before
