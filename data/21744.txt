page_text:

P1	Parna was a tall, slender boy who was in Grade 3. 

He liked to wear the long black coat that his Uncle Teteyo gave him.
P2	During holiday time, Parna looked after his parents' cows.
P3	One day, as Parna looked after the cows, it suddenly started raining.
P4	Just at that time, his father's favourite cow, Blackie, gave birth. 

The calf was the most beautiful calf that Parna had ever seen.
P5	Parna was so happy caring for Blackie and the calf that he forgot about the rest of the cows.
P6	He thought, "Father promised to give the calf to me if it is female."
P7	As he daydreamed, a strong hand pulled him up. 

Parna saw Uncle Teteyo and remembered, "Uncle, where are the cows?"
P8	Uncle Teteyo replied, "Your mother found all the cows in the shed, except Blackie, and you. 

She was afraid so she sent me to fetch you."
P9	Parna excitedly told his uncle how Blackie gave birth to the beautiful calf. 

Uncle Teteyo said, "I'll carry the calf as you and Blackie follow."
P10	Everyone was happy to see Parna, Blackie and the calf safe.
P11	Parna asked his father, "Will you let me have the calf as you promised?"
P12	"Yes, my son, she is all yours. A promise is a promise."
