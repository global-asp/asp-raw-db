page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, Billy-goat and his wife lived in a fenced village. The name of the village was Ganhwa. Goats then, had tails like dogs.
P2	One day, Billy-goat went to the bush to get honey for his family. As he gathered the honey in the pot, rain began to fall on him.
P3	Billy-goat ran into the nearby cave to hide from the rain. As he entered, he met  Hyena. He put down his honey pot. He was scared Hyena would eat him.
P4	As Hyena moved to attack Billy-goat, Lion also ran into the cave. Billy-goat shook his head and his body shuddered. At once, all the water on his body flew off.
P5	"Wao!" Lion exclaimed, "How did you do that?"@"I use this charm called Ganhwa," Billy-goat said, showing his testicles.@" That's nice! Make one for me," Lion demanded.
P6	"We need a fresh hyena skin which must be chewed to become soft," Billy-goat said. Hyena wanted to escape but Lion was close at the mouth of the cave.
P7	Hyena offered his skin so as to save his life. Lion tore it and gave Billy-goat. He dipped it into the honey and offered to Lion. "Chew it first. You must not swallow it," Billy-goat told Lion.
P8	Lion chewed and swallowed the hyena skin. Hyena offered his skin again and again to save his life. Lion swallowed it each time Billy-goat dipped it into the honey and gave him.
P9	Hyena sneaked away as Lion  chewed the next piece of skin dipped in honey. His skin was almost gone. Lion swallowed again and looked up but Hyena was gone. As Lion  ran after Hyena, Billy-goat also fled.
P10	When Lion returned with the piece of hyena skin, he did not meet Billy-goat. He pursued and caught up with Billy-goat as he was about jumping the fence into Ganhwa Village.
P11	Lion reached out to grab the Ganhwa charm swinging between the legs of Billy-goat. He could only grab the tail. The tail cut off but Billy-goat escaped into Ganhwa Village.
P12	That is why Hyena today, has spotted skin and goats have short tails.
