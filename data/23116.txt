page_text:

P1	In the forest, the little elephant was walking with his mother and his older sister. They were walking and singing loudly. Unfortunately the little elephant squeezed his foot on a stone and he stopped and laid at the roadside.
P2	His mother and his sister continued and did not recognized that they left him behind.
He stayed down there alone, lost his way and he couldn't go anywhere.
He was afraid and was crying, thinking of the dangers of the forest.
P3	By chance, Panda was eating near the place where the Little Elephant was resting. 
Panda come to him, touch his head and asked: "- Come with me! in the City where all animals of the earth live."
He could not refuse because he did not have a place to stay in that forest and it was far from his own City.
P4	At his arrival in the city, everyone showed different emotions and reactions.
Some felt in love with the little stranger Elephant, some were sad about him, some were angry but others were even afraid. The fear came because of the king. The king was the Lion and he was a very arrogant king.
P5	The king Lion did not agree that the Little Elephant should stay in the city and said:
"- The one who will not obey my words will go away with him. My kingdom is not for strangers but for the descendants of this place. Now, go away from this city or I will break your bones in thousand pieces."
P6	The Little Elephant was shocked and scared. He did not have much to say and he left.
But Panda, as he became his very good friend, was disturbed and felt that he can't let him be alone and to get lost.
With courage and love, Panda decided to leave everything and travel with the little elephant. To start an adventure togetherâ€¦
On the way home.
