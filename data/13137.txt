page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  Tortoise and Squirrel were very close friends. One day,  Squirrel said to Tortoise,  "My friend,  we have no money,  but market day is getting close. What business can we do to make some money?"
P2	Tortoise responded,  "You know I can make clay plates. I want you to join me in making plates to sell." "Okay my friend,  tomorrow evening I will join you to make the plates," Squirrel said.
P3	On the day of the market,  Tortoise went to the marketplace. He saw two people fighting in the distance. He put down his clay plates and went to watch the fight.
P4	When Tortoise got there,  he saw that it was his friend Squirrel fighting with Mole.
P5	Immediately,  without finding out what caused the fight,  Tortoise took a big stick and began to beat Mole. "Leave my friend alone!" shouted Tortoise.
P6	Mole turned to face Tortoise and bit him deeply on the nose.
P7	Tortoise's nose began to bleed.
P8	Tortoise had impatiently entered into the fight. Since that day,  Tortoise has a crooked nose to remind him not to be so hasty.
