P1	Once the was a little girl who had black African hair.Zimi lived with her Mom who took very good care of her hair
P2	Her hair made her very different from the other girls at school. Others had relaxed long hair and other had braids on. Other girls would call Zimi names because of her hair. Gusha emnyama (black sheep) is how some called her.
P3	Zimi was very quiet at school she had no friends. One day she got back from school and asked her mother, “Mom why don’t you relax my hair just like the other girls at school?” Her mother looked at her with a big smile on her face
P4	My girl you are beautiful with your Afro and so are the other girls with their braids on. You do not have to look like someone else to be pretty. You are beautiful with your Afro. Zimi heard her Mom but she did not look happy at all.
P5	One afternoon Zimi came back from school and she saw her mother having tea with the Chief’s daughter that Zimi loved so much.
P6	As Zimi walked in the lady put her tea on the table and stood up to feel Zimi’s hair. Wow you have beautiful hair and it suits you, you are so pretty.Zimi stood there in shock.
P7	The lady asked Zimi if they could take pictures together. Zimi was so excited. After the Chief’s daughter had left, Zimi told her mother that she doesn’t want to relax her her anymore.
P8	The next day at school Zimi looked so confident and happy. Everyone looked at her and smiled because of the way she carried her self that day. They saw that not even the naughty names they called her would not ruin her day.
P9	For the first time Zimi felt in love with her hair. She  thanked her mother for bringing the Chief’s daughter to their house. You are beautiful my child as I always tell you, with confidence you are more beautiful.
P10	Zimi looked at the pictures again and she was so happy. Thank you Mom she said with a smile.
