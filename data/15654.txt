page_text:

P1	On Sunday,  Jimmy Zogba scored the winning goal.
P2	On Monday,  the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.
P3	"Hey, Rafiki, where's your zebra hair? Your hair's so plain, like you don't care."
P4	"Hey, Rafiki, where's your fake tattoo? Your skin's so boring. You are too."
P5	"Hey, Rafiki, where's your bling? Your teeth are wonky,  that's the thing."
P6	That day, Rafiki walked home slowly.
P7	"Auntie, can I have zebra hair?" "I can't cut you zebra hair. Actually,  I wouldn't dare."
P8	"My skin's so boring, Sisi. Can you make a fake tattoo?" "You don't need one to look like you."
P9	"Mkhulu, I wish I had some bling." "Bling,  my child,  don't mean a thing."
P10	The next weekend, Santi Ramires scored the winning goal.
P11	On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by. "Hey, Rafiki! Looking fine!"
P12	Rafiki shrugged. "I look like me; this style is mine."
