P1	One day, mama bought different fruits.
P2	"When can we have some fruit?" we asked. @@"We will eat the fruit tonight," said mama.
P3	My brother Rahim is greedy. @@He tasted all the fruit. He ate a lot of it.
P4	"Look at what Rahim did!" shouted my little brother. @@"Rahim is naughty and selfish," I said.
P5	Mama was angry with Rahim.
P6	We were also angry with Rahim. @@But Rahim was not sorry.
P7	"Are you going to punish Rahim?" asked little brother.
P8	"Rahim, you will be sorry soon," warned mama.

P10	"My stomach is painful," whispered Rahim.
