page_text:

P1	The next morning,  Sun woke up very early. It shone bright and strong the whole day. People washed all their clothes. The clothes did not take long to dry. "See,  I am the most powerful," said Sun.
P2	 The next morning,  Rain woke up very early. It rained heavily the whole day. People filled all their big and small containers with water. "See,  I am the most powerful," said Rain.
P3	In January and February,  Sun woke up early every day and shone strongly. All crops and grass dried up. People were thirsty. Animals had no water.
P4	Every place was very hot. People looked for small rivers for swimming.
P5	In March,  Rain suddenly started pouring. It rained in the morning. It rained in the afternoon. It rained in the evening and night.
P6	Everything was wet. Then the weather became cold. People had to cover themselves with long jackets and big hats. Everything was muddy.
P7	The farmers got excited. They planted a lot of crops for food. They hoped that the crops would grow quickly once the rain stopped.
P8	After some time,  everybody was fed up with Rain. Animals from the bush and forest looked for safer places on dry land.
P9	Finally,  Sun came but was very weak. The weather became colder.
P10	No one liked the weather.
P11	People asked each other about Sun and Rain. They wanted to know who is more powerful. What do you think? Who is more powerful? Sun or Rain?
