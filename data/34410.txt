page_text:

P1	I was reading a magazine when I came across a lovely jacket.
P2	I went to my father and asked, "Baba, please will you buy this jacket for me?"
P3	"Thanyani, do you mean this jacket?" father asked. @@"Why do you want this pink jacket?" @@He looked worried.
P4	"Baba, I like that jacket because pink is my favourite colour," I replied.@@He did not look happy at all.
P5	Father said to me, raising his voice, "Pink is for girls, and you are a boy. Ask for a blue jacket, man!"
P6	I wondered to myself, but why can't I love pink? @@Can't boys love pink? Does this also mean that girls can't love blue?@@Why is pink for girls and blue for boys?
P7	What I do know, is that pink worries father.@@I am a boy who likes pink.  I worry my father. @@But what is it about pink that upsets him?
P8	Look inside the mouth of the person next to you. @@You will see that we are all pink inside.@@When father shouts at me, I can see that that even his mouth is pink inside!
