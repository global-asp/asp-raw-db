desc:	Thabani receives a gift from his brother. It is a spear! Will Thabani have the courage to use his spear?

page_text:

P1	Thabani was a young boy who was small for his age. He had an older brother who was strong, handsome, and a respected warrior. Thabani looked up to his brother Qhawekazi as his hero.
P2	One day Qhawekazi gave Thabani a gift of a spear. Thabani was over the moon! Qhawekazi believed that Thabani would grow bigger and stronger, and that he would fight and win battles in his time.
P3	Qhawekazi would go and fight battles from time to time. He won some battles and he came back with awards. He lost some battles and he came back with injuries.
P4	Thabani would sing praise songs when his brother won a battle.
P5	When Qhawekazi was not successful in a battle, Thabani would nurse his injuries.
P6	Every morning, Thabani would wake up, take his spear and sharpen the blade on a stone. He truly appreciated this gift from his brother.
P7	The blade was ready for use. When Qhawekazi went to battle, Thabani would wish that he was going with him. But he would always apologise and give the excuse that he was still sharpening his spear.
P8	Thabani continued to sharpen the spear, regardless of its state. The blade got smaller and smaller until it was the size of a knife.

One day Qhawekazi said, "Thabani, you are old enough now and your spear is ready for use."
P9	"Take your spear and let’s go," said Qhawekazi. He gave Thabani no chance to think. 

Thabani followed his brother, shivering. Qhawekazi realised too late that the spear was greatly reduced from too much sharpening.
P10	They arrived on the battlefield. Thabani had only his very small spear and he was  terrified. Qhawekazi put his brother behind him so that he was protected. Thabani’s spear was useless for battle.
P11	Qhawekazi got injured while he was fighting. Thabani made sure that his brother could continue. He used the small spear for cutting leaves to cover the wounds of Qhawekazi and the other warriors in their group.
P12	They came back from the battle excited. Qhawekazi got help from Thabani and Thabani got help from Qhawekazi. 

The enemy was defeated!
