page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there lived a boy and he just woke up in the morning and wanted to eat some yummy cereal for breakfast!
P2	So his mom poured some cereal in the bowl and put some milk in it as well!
P3	But....... OH NO! He felt that the cereal he was eating wasn't actually cereal!...........
P4	IT WAS POUDING! His mom must-have poured the pouding in the bowl instead of cereal! Silly of his mom!
P5	So he tried pouring in some sugar to make it taste better but............
P6	IT MADE IT WORSE! He spit it out and then he yelled out for his dad to help him.
P7	His dad came and helped him making his cereal better by adding the other sugar but still worse! So, they decided to go to the store and buy some cereal for the little boy to eat for breakfast!
P8	When they came home, they had fresh cereal for the boy to eat! It was delicious! ðŸ¥£THE ENDðŸ¥£
