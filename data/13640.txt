page_text:

P1	This is the story of Keeper and his nursery for orphaned animals.
P2	Last month was a busy month at the nursery. The first one to arrive at the nursery was  one-year old Nomsa. She was thin and sad.
P3	But soon,  Nomsa got stronger. She began to play with the other animals.
P4	On another day that month,  a helicopter landed at the nursery.
P5	In the helicopter was a small elephant under big blanket. Her name was Ndiwa.
P6	Ndiwa was five days' old. Keeper fed Ndiwa with a bottle.
P7	One night,  everybody was woken up by the arrival of Ambia,  a giraffe.
P8	Ambia was five months' old. She was weak after her long journey.
P9	Because of her long neck,  Keeper held the bottle high to feed Ambia.
P10	The last orphans to arrive that month were three hungry cubs. Their names were Kopi,  Kepi and Keji.
P11	Keeper and his helpers love all of the animals,  even the naughty ones.
P12	The people at the nursery work hard. They hope that one day the orphans can look after themselves. Then these animals can return to the wild.
