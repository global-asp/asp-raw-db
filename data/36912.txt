page_text:

P1	My name is Enrica Smith, I'm the youngest of five kids. Being the youngest is so much fun, my older siblings often bully me and I don't like it. My dad usually shouts at them to leave me alone. They only listen for that time and the next day they at it again.
P2	Even though I fight with them a lot, I know that when it comes to my wellbeing they always have my back. I don't like what they are doing but one thing I know for sure, is that they love me and I love them a lot.
P3	My Dad is the pillar of my strength, my number one supporter. My dad introduced me to soccer, I'm our school's mid-fielder. I love playing soccer.
P4	The fun side of being the youngest is that I get spoiled by our dad. After every match I play my dad buys me my favorite chocolate chip ice-cream and says, I shouldn't tell the others.
P5	I love my dad he is always there when I need him and he makes sure that I'm always happy.
P6	I was very young when my mom passed away and I really miss her. I wish she was still around to take me shopping, oh how I loved it when she bought me new things.
P7	I only have a few memories of my mom and when my siblings speaks about her they tell me how much fun she was. She was extremely funny and always had a smile on her face.
P8	I miss her more with each passing day, if only I had another day, to see that smile upon her face. I know she is my guardian angel in heaven. Mom I love you so much I wish you didn't have to leave. Dad says, one day mom and I will meet again and that brings me so much comfort knowing she will be waiting for me.
P9	I love my family and I'm truly thankful for all their love and support and for helping dad when it comes to raising me.
P10	The End.
