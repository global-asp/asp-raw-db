P1	It was the first wedding in the Roberts family,  and Mary had never been so excited in her life. "My chickens,  I am going to be John and Hawa's bridesmaid,  with a new dress and shoes!" she said to her chickens. Mary told her chickens everything. Her father had given the chickens to her as a birthday present,  and she loved them very much.
P2	"Take those dirty scruffy chickens out of here Mary!" shouted her mother,  "I don't want them anywhere near this wedding tent."
P3	Mary shooed her chickens out of the tent. "Run away you silly things." she said,  "I don't want you to be eaten at John and Patience's wedding!"
P4	"Mme says that this is going to be the best wedding ever seen in Buchanan," Mary told her chickens,  "and she says that I can help all the older girls with the cooking." The chickens paid no attention to her. "Mary!" called her mother from inside,  "leave those chickens of yours and come and help me with these pots please!"
P5	Mary followed her chickens out into the yard. "Mama is right,  you are a disgrace," she scolded them So Mary thought for a while. Suddenly she smiled and said to herself,  "I have an excellent idea." She went and filled a bucket with water from the spring. Mary had a lot of trouble catching her chickens. They did not think that a bath was such a good idea.
P6	Mary put the first chicken into the bucket of water. It clucked at the top of its voice and flapped its wings like crazy. "Hold still you silly thing," Mary shouted,  "this won't take long!" When Mary wiped the chicken's nose and eyes it suddenly went limp and flopped over the side of the bucket.
P7	"This is no time to sleep," said Mary. She gave it a good shake to get all the water out. "If you are not going to wake up now,  I'll have to put you somewhere to dry nicely," she said. She laid the chicken out on the grass to dry. The chicken lay completely still.
P8	Mary washed each and every one of her chickens. Each and every one of them went limp and floppy before she was finished with it. She put all those eight chickens in a row on the grass to dry. Not one of them moved a single feather. "I'll leave them to sleep a little," Mary thought to herself,  and off she went to check on the collard greens.
P9	Mrs. Teeweh and Mrs. Beh were Mary's aunts. They did not like each other at all. The aunts had been preparing for months for Patience's wedding,  but they would not even think about riding together in the same taxi.
P10	Mrs. Teeweh spotted Mary's chickens laid out to dry. "What a nice little snack for me to take home!" she said to herself. She took off her shawl and carefully wrapped all those chickens up in it. Not a single chicken moved. "Perfect!" she smiled,  "now I shall put them somewhere where Mrs. Beh will not ever find them," and she put the bundle around the corner among the pumpkin vines.
P11	Patience's wedding was wonderful. Those chickens did not get up off the roof to join in when all the bridesmaid ladies danced into the yard. Not one of the chickens stirred when the church choir sang in their loudest,  sweetest voices. The chickens were still lying on the roof when the priest gave his sermon. They did not even twitch a feather when the pigs and Mary's grandfather all snored loudly in the middle of the sermon. Not one foot of those chickens trembled when sheep wandered into the tent,  nearly knocking over the wedding cake.
P12	It was only when the groom's father was halfway through his speech that things started to change on that roof.
