page_text:

P1	Long time ago, Hare and Hyena were good friends.
P2	Hare said to Hyena, “Let us do farming together.”
P3	Hare suggested that they should plant maize and share duties.
P4	Hare told Hyena, “My work of chasing birds is difficult.”
P5	Hyena agreed to till the land alone.
P6	When Hyena pulled out weeds, Hare sat down singing.
P7	When the maize was ready, Hare enjoyed chasing birds away.
P8	Hare said, “I harvest above the soil. You harvest below.”
P9	Hare harvested all the maize and stored it.
P10	Hyena found only roots under the soil.
P11	Hyena realised that he was cheated. 

He was angry.
P12	They planted potatoes. 

Hyena said, “I will harvest above the soil.”
P13	They worked on the farm together, singing.
P14	At harvest time, Hyena harvested only potato leaves.
P15	Hare harvested a lot of big potatoes and stored them.
P16	Hyena chased Hare to get revenge. 

Their friendship ended.
