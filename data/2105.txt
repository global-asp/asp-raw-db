desc:	Hyena wants to know what the white mark is at the back of Raven’s neck. On hearing that it is meat

page_text:

P1	Hyena and Raven were once great friends,  even though they were quite different in some ways. Raven could fly but Hyena was only able to walk.
P2	One day Hyena,  curious to know something about his friend,  asked Raven,  "What is this white thing which is always below your neck?"
P3	Raven was not mean,  so he gave him some feathers. Hyena sewed them together into wings. He fastened them to his body,  and tried to take off into the sky. But he was far too heavy for the few feathers to carry him. So he had to think of another plan.
P4	"Please my friend," he asked Raven,  "could I hold onto your tail as you fly up into the sky?" "All right," said Raven. "I know how much you want to fly. Let's do it tomorrow morning." When day came,  Hyena took hold of Raven's tail and Raven flew up into the sky.
P5	Raven flew and flew and flew until he was exhausted. But Hyena said,  "Just a little further,  my friend!" He could see the white and fatty meat just above them,  and his mouth was watering.
P6	Finally,  the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate,  the fatty meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the 'meat',  all he felt was moist cloud!
P7	By now he was falling fast. "Help,  help!" he shouted. But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.
P8	Hyena fell on the ground with a crash and lay silent for some minutes. He woke up howling in pain,  with a broken leg and dark scars all over his body.
P9	From that day to now,  Hyena limps and he has many scars on his body. He has never been able to fly. And he and Raven are no longer friends.
