page_text:

P1	The wind howled like a wolf.@@Salemka'an ran out with her kite to play.
P2	The wind played with her hair.@@The wind played with her dress.@@Soon, the wind grew stronger and so she lost@her kite.
P3	The wind continued to blow stronger.@@Salemka'an ran to get the clothes from the@line.
P4	The wind was faster than her. @@It swirled and churned.@@It carried her kite and clothes. @@It carried the house, the trees and even the leaves.
P5	The wind churned and weaved them all together into a vortex.
P6	Then the wind began to calm. @@It dropped some trees.@@Salemka'an's kite was stuck to a branch.
P7	The wind tossed her kite.@@It tossed some leaves around.
P8	The wind dropped Salemka'an from the sky along with a tree.@@She twirled and twirled.
P9	She held on to the roots because she felt woozy,@woozy.
P10	She staggered up, still holding on to the roots.@@She looked around for everything the wind@weaved into a vortex.
P11	She saw her house.@@She saw a few leaves and tree trunks.@@She didn't see her kite but walked home all the@same.
P12	Salemka'an knew that the wind would blow again. @@"I'll see my kite again," she thought.
