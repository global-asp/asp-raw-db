page_text:

P1	Ringoe chased his children through the woodland forest that they lived in. He lived in the clearing in the heart of the forest with his beautiful mare and their two daughters.
P2	In the middle of the clearing there was a vast willow tree of great power. It could control any animal that set foot in the forest, except those with evil hearts. There were fearsome horses that protected it called the Seven Deadly Horses.
P3	On the other side of the forest there was a cruel desert where there were evil people and heavy-hearted predators. The People had taken the predators as slaves.  The People wanted the power of the Willow.
P4	The People had been trying to take the power of the Willow ever since Ringoe’s great great grandfather planted it. “We should put poison in the Seven Deadly Horses’ food and water!” said the king of the People. “I’ll send my best soldiers.”
P5	Seven nights later, the Seven Deadly Horses fell asleep for twenty four hours. The soldiers and predators got into the clearing, but one of them stood on a twig and Ringoe’s children woke up.
P6	“Who is that?” whispered one of them.@ “I don’t know!” muttered the other. “We better wake Daddy!” @“What? Why are you waking me up?” asked Ringoe.@“Because people are here!” whispered his daughter.
P7	Ringoe woke the other horses and silently surrounded the intruders. The soldiers attacked! There was a big fight. The soldiers escaped but the predators got captured.
P8	“Who are you?” asked one of the predators.@“We are the Horses. Would you like to be free?” replied Ringoe.@“Yes! Yes! We would love to be free!” hollered the predators.
P9	Back in the desert, the king was furious with his soldiers. @“You fools! Why didn’t you get the power of the Willow?!” he screamed.@“Its not that easy! Ringoe attacked us!” @The king noticed that the predators were missing.
P10	“Where are the predators?” demanded the king.@“They got captured mumbled the soldiers. @“This means war!” growled the king.
P11	Back in the clearing, the predators had become allies. The Willow freed their hearts and they were happy for once.@Ringoe sent out spies. The next day, the spies came back and told Ringoe that an army was coming.
P12	The Willow whispered to all of the creatures of the forest “Help the horses! Help the Horses! If you don’t you will die!”@All of the animals gathered in the clearing and Ringoe told them what to do.@“Put traps out and get your armour on!”
P13	They went to the edge of the forest and hid. The army of the People walked straight into an ambush. Hundreds of people got captured in the traps. Ringoe kicked people and the Seven Deadly Horses attacked. The predators joined in.
P14	More and more people came, and the horses began to lose. The Willow called for the trees to help. They hit and strangled the People. The People got scared and retreated. The Horses had won the War of the Willow.
P15	All of the animals celebrated through the night. From that night on, the predators guarded the forest, and Ringoe and the Seven Deadly Horses protected the Willow. The People never made it into the forest again.
P16	The End.
