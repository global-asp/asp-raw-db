page_text:

P1	A fox once saw a crow flying with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on branch of a tree.
P2	'That is for me, as i am a Fox, ''said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.
P3	''Good day, Mistress crow, ''he cried.''How well you are looking today; how bright your eyes.
P4	I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of the birds.''.
P5	The crow lifted up her head and began crow her best,  but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the  ground, only to be snapped by Master Fox.
P6	''That will do, ''said he.''That was all I wanted. In the exchange of your cheese I  will give you a piece of advise for the future; ''Do not trust flatterers.''.
