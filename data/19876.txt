page_text:

P1	Mdogo and Juma are friends who love running. They run together every day.
P2	One day,  Juma said,  "Let's run across our continent. Let's race to support the idea of African unity!" "Let's go!" cheered Mdogo.
P3	They decided to carry a unity torch on their journey. They started the race in the far south,  in Cape Town.
P4	From South Africa they headed along the west coast. They ran through Namibia,  Angola,  DRC,  Congo and Cameroon. They rested in Abuja.
P5	West African runners joined the friends in Nigeria. They continued together,  following the River Niger further west.
P6	A sandstorm in Mali made it difficult to run. Juma was the strongest of all of them. He led the way safely.
P7	At Guinea's coast in Conakry the dusty runners washed in the sea. Then they decided to race to Morocco through Senegal and Mauritania.
P8	At Casablanca the runners played with other young people on the beaches. Next,  they set off across north Africa.
P9	They ran through Algeria and Libya,  and stopped in Egypt to visit the pyramids. Then they headed east,  following the River Nile to Uganda.
P10	They ran through deserts and national parks. More young people joined them in Kampala. The group headed for Kenya's coast.
P11	In Mombasa they sat on the beach and ate coconut rice with fish. Juma said,  "Let's take the unity torch to Mount Kilimanjaro."
P12	But Juma was tired. On the way to Tanzania,  he fell down. All the runners stopped and turned back to help Juma.
P13	Juma passed on the torch to Mdogo. He said,  "You carry the torch to Mount Kilimanjaro. Light a flame for African unity."
P14	People cheered the runners saying,  "You are our heroes."Â  After lighting a unity flame high on Kilimanjaro,  they continued back into southern Africa.
P15	They stopped to swim in Lake Malawi. Mdogo said to Juma,  "We've run south to north and back again. Our journey is ending."
P16	The unity runners finally carried the torch to Great Zimbabwe. Crowds gathered at this important place. "What a race!" smiled Juma.
