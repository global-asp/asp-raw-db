page_text:

P1	In a secluded neighborhood near the forest, lived a man with his wife and son. They lived there for a long time and were poverty-stricken. The man would wake up early to go hunt food for his family to eat. He made sure that he provides.
P2	One sunny morning, he decided to go hunt for something bigger "siza kuba nesidlo esimnandi ngokuhlwanje" he said to his family. On his way, under a tree, he saw a giraffe that was tied by the tree trunk and could not free itself.
P3	He thought to himself that he must save the poor giraffe, it was clear that it has been there for a while. He thought of the promise he made to his family about having a feast, but he believed in "umntu ngumntu ngabantu" phrase.
P4	He did not give up as he wanted to help the giraffe. Eventually, he was able to get it out of the rope using his spear. However, the giraffe got overly excited as it realized that it was free from the rope "nazo ke" he sighed tirelessly.
P5	As soon as the rope was gone, the only the giraffe wanted to do was to run away. It is possible that it wanted to be away from the forest because it was scared that it might get back to being tied by the tree. The man fell to the ground.
P6	"Hewena woza lana!" the man shouted at the giraffe. He tried to grab it by its tail (groaning) trying to make it stand still. However the giraffe had more strength than the man and managed to get away.
P7	Tired and disappointed, the man went home without anything in his hands to give to his family. He knew that he did not keep his promise. He then realized that family always comes first no matter what and promises are meant to be kept.
