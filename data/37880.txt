page_text:

P1	So i was admitted in a new school. I was quit happy as well as exited to get new friends. So it was my first class. A girl sat just behind me. I was unable to say anything as i was new. So she started talking with me. She asked me " Did you
P2	bought new copies" . Then i said " no, i didn't ". After that she sat down quietly. I noticed she was so uncomfortable in her single bench, so uncomfortable that she took another sit beside me. So slowly we started talking with each other.
P3	We became best friends. But slowly i got to know about her. She always used to backbite behind me. And not only me, she used to behave like that with everyone. But one day i lost my temper, so i blocked her, maybe i didn't talk to her for
P4	1 week. But you won't believe she even told everyone that the fault is mine and now i blocked her.  I was helpless as she was ruining my reputation in my school. So i unblocked her. But for that fight everyone misunderstood me. And everyone
P5	just blamed me. I lost all my besties. I was so angry with her, but what else could i do. I lost every friend of mine. But slowly i started talking to her normally. I am a  every emotional kind of person. I thought that she's good. But i
P6	was wrong,absolutely wrong. When i told her that i love her... She said that " What now...are you feeling guilty? or you have come to me as you have lost all your besties!!! ". Seriously!!!!! she she she...Okayyyy...so it is actually my
P7	fault... I should have understood her earliar. If i had, then i would have been suffer today. @@@@Moral : Never trust someone so easily!!!
