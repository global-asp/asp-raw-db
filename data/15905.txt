page_text:

P1	Once upon a time in a village there lived a boy named Thabo.
P2	Thabo was friends with a girl called Lerato. They were neighbours.
P3	One day they went to get water.
P4	When they were near to the spring,  they saw a cow lying there. They sat down and talked about how they could play with it.
P5	Then Thabo started to imitate the cow. "Muuu,  muuu,  muuuuuuu!" he said in a clear,  loud voice.
P6	Until the cow turned to look at them. Suddenly Lerato got a fright. Thabo realised that she was scared.
P7	Thabo said,  "Let's go to this cow and hit it. It will run away and then we can get water." "Thabo,  I'm afraid!" said Lerato trembling.
P8	Thabo went first. Lerato went slowly. They tried to hit the cow,  but it didn't move.
P9	Thabo said,  "Lerato,  you can stay here. I will fetch the water." Lerato agreed.
P10	Thabo scooped the water into the first bucket.
P11	While he was scooping the water into the other bucket the cow stood up. She picked up Thabo with one horn,  and threw him onto her neck.
P12	Thabo shouted,  "Joo,  jooo,  jooooo!" Lerato burst out laughing,  she could not stop.
P13	The cow said,  "Mmuuu,  mmuuu,  muuuuuuuuuuu!"
P14	When at last Lerato stopped laughing,  she ran home as quickly as she could. When she arrived,  she found Ma Mathabo sweeping outside.
P15	She said,  "Ma Ma Ma,  the co co cow has taken Thabo!" Lerato was panting.
P16	Ma Mathabo dropped her broom and ran. What do you think happened next?
