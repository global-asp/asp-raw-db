page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a clan of hyenas living in the Far East. They have lived there for many years. As time went by, the land became dry and the water was scarce. Everyone was worried. @@One day the leader of the clan had an idea.
P2	The pile was so tall. The hyena at the top said "It is very cloudy up here", then told the hyenas to pass on the message to their leader. Before he could get the message, rain started pouring from the sky.
P3	The higher they piled up on one another, the harder it was to keep their balance. "Keep your balance!", the leader shouted. The hyenas then slowly gained balance as they continued to pile up on one another. The pile grew taller.
P4	The leader said "If we pile up on one another and make a tall enough tower, we can touch the sky and open it so we can have more rain". The hyenas laughed, then realised it would be a great idea and began piling up on one another.
