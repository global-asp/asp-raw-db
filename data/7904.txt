P1	After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say,  "Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?" Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree,  but he trusted Ngede.
P2	After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree. Togar hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gartee as if to say,  "Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?" Gartee couldn't see any bees from under the tree,  but he trusted Togar.
P3	So Gartee put down his hunting spear under the tree,  gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire. When the fire was burning well,  he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began climbing,  holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth.
P4	Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their hive. When Gartee reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came rushing out,  angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke – but not before they had given Gartee some painful stings!
P5	When the bees were out,  Gartee pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb,  dripping with rich honey and full of fat,  white grubs. He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder,  and started to climb down the tree.
P6	Togar eagerly watched everything that Gartee was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide. Togar flittered from branch to branch,  closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gartee reached the bottom of the tree. Togar perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward.
P7	Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gartee,  he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch,  and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him,  Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Togar,  the Honeyguide,  had his revenge. And Gartee learned his lesson.
P8	And so,  when the children of Gartee hear the story of Togar they have respect for the little bird. Whenever they harvest honey,  they make sure to leave the biggest part of the comb for Honeyguide!
