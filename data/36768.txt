page_text:

P1	Once upon a time there was an elephant family. One day a baby elephant named Daisy asked "What does a lion and leopard eat for lunch?" All the elephants were puzzled by this question so they said "Go to the Lions Den and you will get the answer."
P2	So Daisy set off with five apples, three bunches of grapes and two watermelons. On her journey she met a meerkat and he helped the little elephants with directions to the Lions Den. The elephant was very thankful and gave the meerkat a bunch of grapes and said "Good bye."
P3	Along the way Daisy met a dragon and he carried her to the Lions Den.There she met a giraffe, a herd of zebra, a monkey, rhino, ostrich and the meerkat. They were very friendly. Then Daisy asked the animals "Where does the lion and leopard live?" The animals were very suprised she asked that question, so the rhino said "Why on earth would you ask that question little Daisy?"
P4	"I have a very important question to ask them and I shall not go home without the answer." So the animals went with Daisy to the Lions Den. The lion and leopard came out of the den. Little Daisy stepped forward and said to them "What does a lion and leopard eat for lunch?" The lion said "Come closer," so Daisy came closer.
P5	Then he said again "Come closer." The  leopard said "Come closer so I can whisper it in your ear." Daisy came a little closer, then they said "We are going to eat you for lunch!" They pulled little Daisy by the ears, the dragon saw what was going on and pulled Daisy free. Daisy was very thankful but there was a problem, her ears were stretched from the fight.
P6	Daisy was very upset but the animals cheered her up by telling her all the great things she could do with her new ears. Now she could fan herself and she could swim with her ears. She was delighted and thanked everyone who helped her.
P7	The dragon took Daisy home and she told her family what happened to her and they were very proud of little Daisy and she was a hero to her family.
