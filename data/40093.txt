page_text:

P1	It was on Friday morning, the sun was shinning  in the dew like broken pieces of glass. The birds were singing their joyful songs. My mother prepared herself as fast as she could. Later she left to the hall for preparations.
P2	Within a fraction of a second I had a knock on the door. I thought it was my mother but when I opened the door and what I saw made my eyes almost pop out of the socket, it was my best friend Sheila who she joined me to decorate the hall.
P3	My mother yanked the rock and opened the door. She gave me a coloured puple dress as my gift. She told me to early up so that we could walk to the hall where my birthday party was organized by my friends and my mother.
P4	I later walked to the hall majestically on a purple dress along with my friend Sheila. The hall was decorated with purple, white and pink balloons and flowers. The place looked really attractive. There were a lot of people invited.
P5	A purple and a white decorated cake was brought for me to cut and they started singing for me with Melody voices." Happy birthday to you..."I was so excited and happy as a king. My friends and relatives brought alot of gifts to me.
P6	We celebrated the birthday with music, foods, drinks and everyone was happy as a king's daughter walking around the palace. What a day it was. I wished to celebrate more birthdays to come in that manner.
