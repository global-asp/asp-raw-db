desc:	Deceived I was after loving a woman who looked beautiful and showed love upon meeting not knowing the truth about her background and desire.

page_text:

P1	Demon talks of the demon@It has a sweet whispering pines@It has candy voice like vodka in it@The voice of reasons and diet as whisk.@It looks plain blue as the sky.@Evy, desperation and distraction are his.
P2	They are sweet like dreams of the earth kiss.@It has a voice of the sapient of love from the Eden prairie dog I thought.@You cannot see the shadow of Mordor in it.@They never trust your soul of Denver  and thoughts.
P3	The sapient of love and kisses you softly dreams as a virgin princess.@They have a blessed voice of the gods of earthly dreams.@The voice of the day and night are in your soul if are within you.
P4	Never trust the sapient of demon of Eden that you have within.
