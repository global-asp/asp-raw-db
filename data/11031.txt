page_text:

P1	We are in Cape Town on holiday. We are excited because Mom and Dad are taking us to the park next to the sea.
P2	Look at the tall slide. Am I brave enough to climb up and slide down?
P3	My sister and I want to play on the see saw. I wonder which one of us is heaviest?
P4	Mom and Dad need to push us when we want to swing. I am going to try to swing the highest.
P5	Look at these white horses. They are statues.
P6	We read the sign which shows us what fun we can have with the horses.
P7	We visit the lighthouse. Mom and Dad say it is very old.
P8	Lighthouses are important at night and in the fog. They alert ships to the rocks in the sea.
P9	We have had a happy time at the park,  but now it is home time. We are going to catch a bus.
P10	Thank you Mom and Dad for our treat. We are tired but very happy!
