P1	Chapter 4 — I CAN COUNT TO 20!@@PREREQUISITE: Can count to 20 comfortably and have a good sense of those quantities. Is also comfortable adding and subtracting small numbers and understands connections such as number bonds and fact families.@@—  WHERE YOU'VE BEEN  —@@Your child has come so far! They can now count up and down between 0 and 20 and understand what all those quantities mean. Your child is comfortable "counting on" or "counting down" starting at any number in between 0 and 20. There is also a budding understanding of place value and how that relates to expanded form.@@Calculational abilities have also grown! Beyond adding and subtracting small numbers, your child has a sense of the number relationships of number bonds and fact families.
P2	The ideas of adding and subtracting 1 or 2, adding twins, and near twins, are ready to form the foundation for learning all the addition and subtraction facts. Your child has also picked up skip counting by 2, doubling, halving, and even and odd numbers — all of which are setting the stage for learning multiplication and division.@@—  NEW IDEAS IN THIS CHAPTER  —@@    • Counting to 100 — While it's fun to hear your child count to 100, keep this practice grounded in understanding the numbers — place value and counting backwards will help a lot with this.@@    • Expanded Form and Place Value — The earlier practice with this will be reinforced here. Understanding tens and ones, and using expanded form (such as 37 = 30 + 7), is essential to understanding numbers.@@    • Comparing double-digit numbers — Understanding place value will make this easy.
P3	• All single-digit adding and subtracting — This is first done with manipulatives, especially fingers. Then, using ideas involving relationships between numbers, it will be extended to mental arithmetic.@@    • Compensation for Addition and Subtraction — Adjusting addition and subtraction problems to make them easier to do not only helps with mental arithmetic, it helps teach the structure of numbers.@@    • Skip Counting — Skipping up and down by any single-digit number starting anywhere is great practice for doing mental addition and subtraction, and is useful for learning multiplication and division.
P4	• Beginning multiplying — Your child already knows how to multiply by 2. This will be extended, in part using skip counting, to all single-digit numbers.@@    • Games, Puzzles, Problem Solving and Investigations — The games and puzzles will be more challenging in keeping with your child's growing sophistication and abilities. Keep these activities fun and playful - enjoyment is the most important thing for your child's long term mathematical success. Kindle sparks of joy when your child discovers or experiences particularly beautiful or satisfying mathematical patterns.
P5	*SECTION* — FINGER MATH UP TO 20@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting small single-digit numbers with manipulatives@@—  INTRODUCTION  — @@These teaching activities give simple, reliable methods for your child to understand and perform basic addition and subtraction.@@—  FINGER ADDITION WITH COMPENSATION  —@@Use compensation for sums between 11 and 18 to make them much easier. Suppose you're adding 7 + 8. One person puts up 7 fingers and the other person puts up 8 fingers. Then, one person gives away as many fingers as are needed to put up 10 fingers on the other person's hands. In this example, 7 + 8 could turn into 5 + 10 (giving away 2) or 10 + 5 (giving away 3). @@Be dramatic and give away the fingers by having one person's hand bang into the other person's hand and having the fingers transfer "magically."
P6	—  EASY WAY FINGER ADDITION  —@@Use "counting on" to make addition easy. Suppose you're adding 8 + 3. For ease, pick the larger number being added to start the counting on. Have your child make a closed fist and say "8." Then, lift one more finger each time as your child counts out loud "9, 10, 11." When 3 fingers are raised, the counting stops. At that point, you  have that 8 plus 3 is 11.@@With practice and further ideas, your child will memorize these math facts. However, there is no hurry for memorization and it can wait until more experience with the quantities and relationships between the numbers has been gained.
P7	—  EASY WAY FINGER SUBTRACTION  —@@Subtraction can be thought of as "take away" or "difference" — both models are essential to a complete understanding. Have your child practice both ways using these finger subtraction methods. Let's look at 11 - 3.@@Take Away: Have a closed fist and say "11." Then, lifting one more finger each time, count "10, 9, 8." When your child sees 3 fingers raised, the counting stops, so taking 3 away from 11 leaves 8.@@Difference: This uses counting on, much as we did for Easy Way Finger Addition. We are finding which number we need to add to 3 to get 11. Have your child make a closed fist and say "3." Then, lifting one more finger each time, count "4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11." When your child says 11, there are 8 fingers raised — the difference between 3 and 11 is 8!
P8	*SECTION* — ADDITION UP TO 20@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers with manipulatives@@PUZZLE — ENCLOSED SUMS@@These puzzles have shapes connected by lines. Each enclosed region has a number that is the sum of the shapes that border it. While circles may have any value, a non-circle must have the same value as any figure of the same shape. The puzzle is to figure out the numbers not supplied.@@Create these puzzles by making a diagram of circles and maybe some squares. Next, fill in all the figures with numbers and fill in the bounded regions with the sum of the figures that surround them. Finally, remove some of the numbers.
P9	GAME — PIG@@Ready for some fun risk? During a turn, roll a die as many times as you want. When a roll is not 1, you add that roll to your turn's total. If it is 1, you lose everything for that turn and the turn is over. A player may choose to stop before rolling a 1, keep the turn's points so far, and add them to the player's running total. The first player to reach the target number, say 30, wins.@@A two dice variation has these rules: If neither die shows a 1, the sum is added to the turn's running total. If exactly one of the dice shows a 1, then nothing more is added to the running total and the turn ends. If two 1's are rolled, the turn's total becomes 0 and the turn ends.
P10	GAME — DON'T GO OVER@@Use 5 dice and 4 rolls. On the first roll, choose to save from 0 to 5 of the dice. Once a die is saved it cannot be changed. Similarly with the remaining dice on rolls two and three. On the final roll, all dice are saved. Any score less than or equal to 20 counts, any score over 20 gives the player 0.@@The target score of 20, the number of dice, and the number of rolls, can all be changed to suit younger or older players. For example, you could play this with a target of 12 and 3 dice.
P11	PUZZLE — ISLAND HOPPING — COMPENSATION@@These puzzles show how compensation creates easier problems. The challenge is to find a path that connects all the islands with the same answer. Two islands can only connect if their problem's numbers differ by 1. Only some of the islands will be on the path.@@Make these puzzles by starting with about ten empty circles with some connections. Identify a path from one edge of the islands to the other. Along that path, put in problems whose numbers differ from each other by one. In the nearby islands, put problems with small changes that have different answers.
P12	*SECTION* — NUMBER BONDS AND FACT FAMILIES@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers with manipulatives@@GAME — WAR — ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION@@Evenly split a shuffled deck of playing cards with the face cards removed. If you like, use dominoes instead. Both players turn over their top two cards and add them. The player with the larger sum wins all four cards. If the sums are equal, the next two pairs of cards are added and the winner gets all eight cards. Play this with a single pass through the deck or multiple passes. Either way, the winner is the player who has the most cards.@@For variety, play this using the difference of the two cards. Or, you can add three cards at a time. Another option is to assign one person to be Odd and the other Even. For this, each player turns over a card and the evenness or oddness of the sum determines who gets the cards.
P13	GAME — TARGET GIN RUMMY@@Agree on a target sum, say 10. Remove the face cards and deal seven cards to each player. The remaining cards become a draw pile, and its top card is flipped over to start the discard pile. The goal is to hold seven cards that are broken into separate groups of one or more cards that add up to the target. During a turn, the player has the choice of picking up the top card of the discard pile or the unseen card at the top of the draw pile. That player then discards a card. When a player successfully fills their whole hand, the player lays down the hand and says "Gin!"@@Taking the difference with pairs of cards can be used instead of addition. In that case, deal an even number of cards to each player.
P14	PUZZLE — DIFFTRIANGLES AND SUMTRIANGLES@@The DiffTriangles puzzles (upper two) have triangles and squares that share sides. A triangle always has exactly two squares on its sides, and the remaining side has either a triangle or is empty. A triangle's number is the difference of the two adjoining squares. The challenge is to supply the missing numbers. SumTriangles puzzles (lower two) use addition in place of subtraction. The value of a triangle is the sum of its two or three square neighbors.@@Making puzzles without loops is easy. Draw an alternating sequence of squares and triangles, and then put in numbers starting at one end working your way to the far end. When you are done, remove some of the numbers. Look at the Bonus Material for ideas on how to make these puzzles with loops.
P15	*SECTION* — MENTAL MATH — SINGLE-DIGIT ADD & SUBTRACT@@Prerequisite: Ability to do single-digit addition and subtraction using manipulatives@@— INTRODUCTION —@@These teaching activities give techniques for learning basic addition and subtraction.@@— FLASH CARDS —@@The ease of practicing math facts using flash cards makes them tempting. However, they are often abused by well-meaning helpers and can contribute to math hatred. Beyond the psychological damage that occurs with overly-enthusiastic drill, using flash cards misses out on learning important relationships between numbers. Feel free to use flash cards to give focused practice for a small handful of facts, but please keep the practice very relaxed.@@This section has methods that practice structural insights until the facts become automatic.
P16	— REVIEWING ADDITION SKILLS —@@To do the activities in this section your child should know how to mentally do the following:@@    • add and subtract 0, 1, 2 (and perhaps 3)@    • do adding twins and near twins@    • know the number bonds for 10@    • add 10 to single-digit numbers. @@If your child is weak with any of these skills, this is the time to practice those skills some more.@@— ADDITION COMPENSATION —@@Compensation is a powerful technique for making mental math easier. When adding two numbers, you can get the same sum by shifting over part of one number to the other. Adding 8 or 9 is easy using compensation. For example, add 6 + 9 by shifting 1 from the 6 to the 9, which gives 5 + 10. Similarly, 4 + 8 becomes 2 + 10.@@Use compensation from twins and near twins for what remains:  3 + 5, 3 + 6, 4 + 7, and 5 + 7.  For example, 5 + 7 is the same as 6 + 6.
P17	Some math facts can be done several ways. Challenge your child to find more than one way to do a problem. For example, 5 + 7 can become 6 + 6, but it can also become 2 + 10. This kind of math play will lead to lasting insights.@@— REVIEWING SUBTRACTION SKILLS —@@Before starting these subtraction activities, practice any of the following skills that happen to be weak for your child:@@    • add and subtract 0, 1, 2 (and perhaps 3)@    • subtract numbers 1 or 2 apart@    • know  the number bonds for 10 and how they make subtracting from 10 easy@    • subtract 10 from numbers from 11 to 19.
P18	— USING 10 AS AN INTERMEDIATE STOP —@@For problems with numbers larger than 10, such as 13 - 8, break them into two differences. The distance from 13 to 8 is the distance from 13 to 10 plus the distance from 10 to 8. So, 13 - 8 becomes (13 - 10) + (10 - 8) = 3 + 2 = 5.@@— SUBTRACTION COMPENSATION —@@Compensation for subtraction means adding or subtracting the same amount for both numbers to maintain their distance. Use compensation on 13 - 8 by adding 2 to both numbers to turn the problem into 15 - 10. Single-digit problems can also be done this way. For example, 3 can be added to both numbers in 7 - 3 to make it 10 - 6.
