page_text:

P1	How a parachute responds to air resistance and gravity when allowed to free float in air. @Once the parachute is opened, the air resistance overwhelms the downward force of gravity let it go down.
P2	Explain the difference in distance between the paper plane were able to go.@@@@@The paper plane without wings relies on aerodynamic forces on it body by @the wind to push it upward.
P3	The paper plane with wings goes less ft because when air moves faster the pressure of the air decrease because the wings make air move fast over the top of the wing.
