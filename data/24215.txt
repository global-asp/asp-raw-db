page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there was a boy called Jallo. 

Jallo was very disobedient to his parents. 

People knew that this child behaved badly.
P2	One day Jallo and his mother went to visit their relatives in the village.

Before they left to return home, their relatives gave them a gift.
P3	They took Jallo and his mother to the village's fruit trees, and invited them to take all the fruit that they liked.

Except from the mango tree.
P4	In the garden, Jallo saw a very big mango tree with many ripe mangoes.
P5	Jallo was amazed to see so many ripe mangoes. He decided to pick one.
P6	Although Jallo had been asked not to eat from the mango tree, he did not listen.

He said, "Whatever happens, let it happen, I want to eat this mango."
P7	Jallo's mother warned him again. But he refused to obey her.
P8	On eating the mango, his stomach suddenly started rumbling.
P9	Jallo felt unwell. He started crying. 

His head started to swell.
P10	Then, a mango tree grew out of his head! 

Jallo became a mango tree.
P11	Since that time, whenever someone touches the branches of that mango tree, it sings a song.

The tree sings, "Whoever doesn't obey the elders, will regret. I made Jallo an example."
P12	That's how it is, and why wise people say, "Whoever refuses to listen to the elders, ends up regretting it."
