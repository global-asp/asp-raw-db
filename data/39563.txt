P3	When Lion, their king heard about it, he ordered to see the Hyena immediately.
P4	Hyena arrived before the king, he greeted the king " Long live my king!"
P5	But King Lion was very angry with Hyena. @@The king said, "You will be fed upon by the hungry tigers too".
P6	On hearing that, the king's wife begged on Hyena's behalf. @@"Your Majesty, please forgive him!" she cried.
P7	The king did not kill him. He decided to punish the hyena. The king ordered him to provide two bags of food for each family.
P8	Hyena worked on the farm to get food to feed the other animals.  The animals were very happy that they had gotten food from working on the farm. Both Hyena and other animals learned to work for food.
