page_text:

P1	Everyone has their days that they will never forget in their lives. @@I have many fantastic days I will never forget. But I think that the following moments are the best in my life.
P2	In the first incident, I had played in the local football league in the month of March last in 2021. I was the best player in the league. @@In the first game, I won the golden boot. In the second game, I received a trophy for the best speed player.
P3	In the final game, I was given a golden medal for the best dribbling player in our country. @@The second, was the day that I flew out of the country to visit Europe and England to see the football teams and famous football players.
P4	The football players I wanted to see were Messi, Neymar Junior and Ronaldo. @@As I met them, I learnt a lot of skills and tricks that I can apply in the field.
