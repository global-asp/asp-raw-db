page_text:

P1	This is Palesa. Her name means 'flower' in her language,  Setswana.
P2	In the morning Palesa talks to the orange tree. "Orange tree,  please give us lots of oranges."
P3	Palesa walks to school. On the way she says to the grass,  "Please grass,  grow greener and don't dry up."
P4	Palesa passes wild flowers. "Flowers,  thank you for your bright colours."
P5	At school,  Palesa talks to the little tree. "Tree,  please grow big branches so we can read under your shade."
P6	Palesa talks to the hedge round her school.  "Please grow strong and stop bad people from going inside."
P7	When Palesa returns home,  she visits the orange tree. "Are your oranges ripe yet?" asks Palesa.
P8	"The oranges are still green," sighs Palesa. "I will see you tomorrow orange tree," she says. "Perhaps then you will have a ripe orange for me!"
