desc:	Pig wants to go to the party

page_text:

P1	Years ago, a group of horned animals decided to have a big party high up in the mountains. @@They only invited other animals with horns. No one else.
P2	When the pig heard about the party, he thought, "I don't have any horns. What am I going to do?"
P3	The next day, he had an idea. He'd stick some horns to his head with wax!
P4	It worked, and the pig felt very clever when he was allowed into the party. @@The problem was that the party was taking place close to the sun. @@When the party started heating up, the wax began to melt, and his horns fell off.
P5	The horned animals were shocked. "Who's that one with no horns? Why did he come here?" they asked.
P6	The king of the horned animals commanded, "Grab that pig and throw him down to earth." @@So all the animals, when they heard the king's words, did just that.
P7	They grabbed the pig and threw him down to earth.@@Poor pig! When he fell, he landed on his nose. And his nose was flattened into a snout.
P8	Their job done, all the other animals returned to the party. @@They ate and danced all night. And the king was happy.
P9	The pig's flat snout has been that way ever since.
