page_text:

P1	In the village of Adau. There lived a boy called Wisdom. He wasn't good looking. He was always abused by his elder brother.
P2	"You are called Wisdom but you are foolish"' said his brother. Wisdom became sadder everyday. He got bad grades in school.
P3	One day, Wisdom was walking through a lonely bush path. He saw sick old woman who needed help and he helped her to get home.
P4	The old woman gave Wisdom a wish pot. "Take this pot with you home. You have three chances to have your wishes come true," the old woman said.
P5	First, Wisdom wished for more wishes and he was granted more chances to make wishes. He wished to become handsome and he became handsome.
P6	He wished for wealth which later vanished.
P7	He told his mother about the pot of wishes. His mother advised him to wish for wisdom.
P8	He then wished for wisdom. With wisdom, he got better grades in school. His friends came to him to seek advice. He became rich and wise. The people of his clan made him King when he grew older.
