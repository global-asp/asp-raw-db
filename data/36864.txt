page_text:

P1	One sunny day, Mr. Crow sat on a branch of the marula tree watching the animals busy collecting their food.
P2	Suddenly he saw a piece of paper blow past. Crow swooped down and caught the scrape of paper and read it. It said “DM-BW-2”
P3	“This must be a secrete message”, Crow said to himself. Frog was hopping by and overheard Crow. “A secret?” he said “I love secrets!” Crown showed Frog the note.
P4	“I wonder what it means?” asked Frog, nervously. “DM” Crown muttered. “DM must mean Don’t Move.
P5	Someone is watching me! I’m sure they are tough. I must be in terrible danger. What can I do? I wonder what BM means? Crown asked flapping his wings.
P6	I got it, he screeched. “BW’’ means Beware. I must not move and I must beware. Poor me, what can I do?” Wait a minute, Frog cried. The note is for me “2”.
P7	It means the note is for both of us and We in terrible danger, screeched Crow. We in big trouble! What can we do? Frog croaked
P8	Ooh!, what can we do? They both fell to the ground, holding their heads
P9	Just then Mrs Hen came down the path carrying a shopping basket. “What is the matter with two of you? she asked.
P10	Why are you lying on the ground mourning? Then she saw the scrap of paper and she took it.
