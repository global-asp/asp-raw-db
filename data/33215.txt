desc:	Dog steals crocodile eggs after he doesnt catch any fish from the river.

page_text:

P1	Dog was hungry and decide to go get himself some food that goes with the flow. He got to the river bank and prepared his fishing equipment when a crocodile suddenly appeared from the water.
P2	"Watch it, rough back", said Dog. Crocodile opened her mouth wide to intimidate Dog. "For dog god's sake, close your morning breath mouth and give us some oxygen. Geez!", Dog added. "You will have to find another place to fish. This spot is restricted." Dog packed and started to walk.
P3	On his way out, Dog saw a bunch of eggs. He thought to himself that he would take eggs and cook them since he didn't get any fish. His could feel his stomach grumbling.
P4	"That rough back duck-walking mammal thought he robbed me off of a meal but I know that the dog god always provides for his 'good dogs' like me", Dog thought to himself while filing his bag with the eggs.
P5	Dog got home and made a fire. He put a pot on the fire and laid the eggs next to the fire. Dog thought he could make some scrambled eggs with some of the eggs and boil the rest for tomorrow.
P6	Crocodile realised that her eggs were missing and followed the foot print of the perpetrator. She got to Leopard's house and asked her about the eggs. Leopard said she didn't know anything and referred Crocodile to Dog's house as they have the same foot print.
P7	Back at Dog's house, something interesting was happening. Since Dog placed the eggs next to the fire, they started hatching and running around the house. Dog had now lost his precious meal.
P8	Dog came back and found that the eggs had hatched. He first thought of throwing them out but had another thought. He thought he'd raise the hatchlings as his own and turn them against their devious mom. He grinned while thinking this.
P9	"Hey knucklehead", Dog heard a voice. "I know you're in there. I can smell your ugliness. Give me my eggs and I promise to make your death quick", Crocodile added. "Get off my yard you stone swallowing weirdo. I don't have time for your crooked teeth", said Dog.
P10	Crocodile managed to get through the door and found Dog feeding her hatchlings. Dog got such a fright and was about to run away when Crocodile whipped him with her long tail. "Ouch! That rough rail really hurts", Dog cried out.
P11	Dog thought he was off the hook when suddenly he saw that Crocodile was running after him. "Please stop chasing me. I didn't know they were your hatchlings as they look better than you. Don't get angry because that is a complement, to your kids"
P12	After being chased for a while, Dog thought of putting a stop to this. He stopped Crocodile to apologise. "Look, I'm sorry for taking your eggs. I thought they belonged to that bird with a giraffe neck but can't fly", he said. Crocodile forgave him because he did get a nice whip.
P13	They both went to get the hatchlings. Dog stood by the river bank as he watched the hatchlings and their float away and said "Goodbye, hatchlings. Don't be like your mom and forget to brush your teeth". Crocodile growled and Dog ran away.
