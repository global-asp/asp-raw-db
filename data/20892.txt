page_text:

P1	My friend Kiki and I walk home from school.
P2	One day, a man followed us.
P3	His teeth were brown. He had pimples on the face.
P4	When we looked at him, he shouted at us angrily.
P5	They threw me into a van.
P6	Kiki managed to ran away.
P7	They put me in a dark room. My hands were tied.
P8	A man said, “Eat this food. The journey is long.”
P9	As I ate, the man smoked a cigarette.
P10	Suddenly, the other men came in pulling my friend Kiki.
P11	We heard the men arguing and shouting in the next room.
P12	Kiki said, “We must escape. Our parents cannot pay them.”
P13	We pulled the timber from the window until we saw light.
P14	Kiki climbed out and ran to get help.
P15	The men rushed into the room. The leader was angry.
P16	They went back to the other room and continued arguing.
P17	I heard a voice saying, “Don’t be afraid. Police are here.”
P18	They were shouting and making noise. I heard some gunshots.
P19	A policewoman said, “Everything is over. You are safe now.”
P20	After that day, Kiki and I were more careful.
