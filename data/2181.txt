desc:	Once there was a family with three very obedient children. The problem was that they were made of wax.

page_text:

P1	Once upon a time, there lived a happy family.
P2	The children never fought with each other. They helped their parents at home and in the fields.
P3	But they were not allowed to go near a fire.
P4	They had to do all their work during the night.
P5	Because they were made of wax!
P6	But one of the boys longed to go out in the sunlight.
P7	One day the longing was too strong. His brother and sister warned him.
P8	But it was too late! He melted in the hot sun.
P9	The wax children cried to see their brother melting away.
P10	But they made a plan. They shaped the lump of melted wax into a bird.
P11	They took their bird brother up to a high mountain.
P12	And as the sun rose, he flew away, singing in the morning light.
