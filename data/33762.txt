page_text:

P1	There was an old lady with stomach ache. @@A fairy flew by and stopped to ask why the old lady was crying. @@"I have a terrible stomach ache," she wept. "Can you help me?"
P2	The fairy said "No, I can't help you. I'm Sibusiso, the evil fairy. I only do bad things."@@"Then please, go away," said the woman.@@With an evil chuckle, Sibusiso disappeared. (He became invisible.)
P3	The old lady rubbed her stomach. Before long, another fairy came along. @@This fairy, named Khumo, also asked what was wrong.@@"My stomach is sore!" moaned the old woman.
P4	Khumo responded, "I can help! I will make some medicine for you."@@Invisible Sibusiso was watching.@@He used his magic to send Khumo to the future.
P5	The old lady was surprised, and looked around.@@She couldn't see anyone. She wondered what had happened to Khumo.@@The old lady started moaning again.
P6	A third fairy flew past, and asked her what was wrong.@@ "I have pain in my stomach!" she cried. @@The old lady was losing patience with the fairies.
P7	Without waiting for the third fairy to reply, Sibusiso sent him to the past. @@Sibusiso started giggling. The old lady heard him.@@She got up and began to beat the air with her stick.
P8	Her stick hit Sibusiso, smack! "What is wrong with you?!" she shouted. @@Oww!" he shrieked, and became visible as he fell from the air. "I can't help it! I'm an evil fairy."@@"You can change your ways!" exclaimed the old lady.
