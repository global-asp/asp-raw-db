desc:	Two young childhood friends grow up together in the village. One drops out of school and the other goes on lonely and missing her friend.

page_text:

P1	Every morning when I woke up I hurried to eat my breakfast.
P2	Then I would take my blue blouse and run out of the house to find my friend Muthoni.
P3	Once I found Muthoni,  we would forget everything else.
P4	Muthoni and I would play hide and seek. I hid in big trees,  while Muthoni went behind huts.
P5	We promised each other that we would work hard in school and graduate.
P6	But one day,  Muthoni did not come to school. I stood at the door to our class and waited for her to arrive. But she did not come.
P7	When I returned home that day,  I told my mother about my friend Muthoni.
P8	I continued with school,  but I missed Muthoni very much.
P9	But every day I went to school,  I looked for Muthoni everywhere.
P10	Now I am a lady,  but I still miss my friend Muthoni.
