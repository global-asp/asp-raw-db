P1	Long ago, animals lived together. 

They met to choose a king.

He lied that he had fire.
P3	The animals believed Rooster. 

They chose him king.
P4	One day it rained very much. 

Everything was wet and cold.
P5	Rabbit asked, “Where do we get fire to warm ourselves?”
P6	Monkey said, “We get it from the comb on Rooster’s head.”
P7	The animals send Fox to collect fire from king
 Rooster.
P8	Fox went to take fire without waking Rooster up.

It did not burn.
