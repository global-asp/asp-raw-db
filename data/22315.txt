page_text:

P1	Coffee is a plant which has fruit. The fruit are berries.

Inside the berries are seeds. The seeds are coffee beans.
P2	There are legends about the discovery of coffee. One of them is the legend of Kaldi in Ethiopia.
P3	Kaldi was a young Ethiopian shepherd.
P4	One day his goats ate red berries off the coffee plant and Kaldi noticed that they started jumping around.
P5	Kaldi was eager to know whether the berries gave the goats energy. He chewed the fruit. The taste was extremely bitter!
P6	After a while, Kaldi felt alert and full of energy.
P7	He picked some of the coffee fruit and took it home.
P8	He gave some fruit to his wife.
P9	His wife chewed the berries and felt the same effects that Kaldi had felt.
P10	Kaldi and his wife thought that it was a gift from God.
P11	Days later, Kaldi took some of the fruit and leaves of the coffee plant to a nearby monastery.
P12	Kaldi told the whole story to the monks, and then left the monastery.
P13	The monks secretly followed Kaldi to check whether what he had told them was true.
P14	The monks saw that everything Kaldi told them was true. The goats were in a playful mood.
P15	Back at monastery, the monks told the other monks to boil the coffee fruit.
P16	The monks drank the boiled fruit and found it terribly bitter!

They thought that it was a devil's drink.
P17	They threw the remains of the fruit onto a fire. Suddenly, a nice aroma came from the fire.
P18	A noble idea of roasting, then boiling the seeds came to their minds.
P19	After they had drunk this flavourful beverage, they stayed alert and felt energetic.
P20	Since then, people have drunk brewed coffee to stay awake.
P21	Coffee drinking started in Ethiopia and spread across the world!
