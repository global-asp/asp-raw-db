P1	In a village called Kalum. There lived a short man. His name was Muha although nobody knew it. They did not like him because he was short.
P2	He was popularly referred to as "The Short Man". This made him very sad. He would always sit under the mango tree and wonder why.
P3	One day, fire caught the school in the village. Everybody was afraid. The Short Man was passing and he decided to help.
P4	He ran as fast as his short legs could take him to a nearby house. He carried a big bucket of water on his head. He ran back and poured the water on the fire. He did this repeatedly and the fire was completely out out.
P5	When the villagers saw what had happened, they were happy. They carried him up and danced with him.
P6	As they danced, a man asked, "what is his name?". "My name is Muha", the short man replied.
P7	The villagers started hailing him, "Muha, Muha, Muha". From that day, everybody loved him.
P8	The villagers built a house for him and found him a woman to marry. Her name was Michine. They lived happily ever after.
