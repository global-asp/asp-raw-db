page_text:

P1	Mod the toad was tired of living in water.
P2	"Be careful," said the turtle. "Your skin will dry out."
P3	But Mod was curious. She hopped away.
P4	She looked all around.
P5	She met a purple chameleon next to a puddle of water.
P6	The chameleon started turning pink! Mod jumped away.
P7	Then she saw a hyena starting a fire.
P8	The fire spread around Mod. She was afraid.
P9	The fire burned her skin. She jumped back,  into the puddle.
P10	But her skin was already full of blisters.
P11	Mod found a home under a rock. Her new skin was dry and rough.
P12	Now only frogs have smooth skin and live near water.
