desc:	Its about the lack of forgiveness. If you dont forgive someone for wronging you

page_text:

P1	Long ago, there were two friends, Mouth and Hand. 

They lived like brothers in one village each with his wife.
P2	Afterwards, Mouth lost his wife.

He borrowed from his friend, Hand, what he needed to bury her.
P3	When Mouth returned home, he discovered that  Hand's machete was missing. He went to Hand to explain and to ask for forgiveness. 

Hand did not listen to his explanation. He wanted Mouth to return the exact machete he had borrowed from him.
P4	Mouth did not know what to do. He decided to return to the grave to see if he had forgotten the machete there. He checked everywhere, but did not find it.

In the end, he decided to dig up the grave. He was surprised when he did not find his wife's body in the grave.
P5	Sad and worried, Mouth returned home. When he was near, he saw a dog carrying the machete he was looking for. He also heard his wife's voice saying, "This is your Helper."

Mouth took the machete and returned it to Hand. He stayed with the dog.
P6	The dog lived with Mouth hunting for him. One day, Mouth stopped calling him 'dog' and instead called him 'Helper'.

They lived happily for a long time until friendship between Mouth and Hand was restored.
P7	Later, Hand wanted to eat meat, but he did not have a hunting dog to help him. He went to his friend Mouth to ask for his dog.

Mouth did not hesitate to give him Helper. He warned Hand not call him dog, but Helper.
P8	Hand went with Helper everywhere he wanted. Everything he wanted done, Helper did it.

He sent Helper to the forest to hunt. Hand was very happy with Helper's work.
P9	One day when they were in the forest, Helper got lost. Hand called him, "Helper! Helper! Where are you?"

He got tired calling and angrily, he said, "This dog is so stupid." At that moment, Helper appeared and said, "You called me, dog! I'm going away." And left.
P10	Hand returned home without Helper. He went to his friend Mouth to inform him that Helper was lost. Mouth was not happy. He told Hand to bring his Helper back but Hand was unable to do so.

Since that day, hand has been mouth's helper.
