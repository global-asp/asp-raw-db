page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  a little boy named Eissa was at home. He did not like to listen. One day his parents gave him a song, "Never eat x2,  without washing,  your hands. Never eat without washing your hands." Eissa didn't want to listen at all,  so he ignored his parents. Neither did his sister Aysha.
P2	He ran into a big lion on the way to the forest. He said "Release me and i will give you pure fruit that does not need to be washed at all." "Really? What type of fruit." Asked Eissa.
P3	"Okay. I will set you free" said Eissa. "On condition you give me a pure fruit" said Eissa. The lion was very happy and gave Eissa a pure apple.
P4	Eissa ate the apple happily and went home not thinking about it. He soon got stomach upset. His parents and siblings saw that there was something wrong with him. Eissa was pretending not to be sickA few days passed and his stomach upset did not stop at all. He finally told his parents about his issues. "Did you eat anything bad?" asked his mother.?Did you eat something bad?
P5	"Why did you eat that fruit Eissa?" His elder brothers Ken and Sean asked him." A lion told me that it was clean and." said Eissa before Ken interrupted him. "Wait! Let me get this strait! YOU SPOKE TO A LION" said Ken. "HAHAHAHAH" his brothers burst into laughter. Eissa felt very ashamed,  embarrassed and sad. He ran to his room and banged the door angrily.
P6	'Why do they make fun of me. Why. I feel so embarrassed. I wish i had never accepted to eat that apple the talking lion gave me.
