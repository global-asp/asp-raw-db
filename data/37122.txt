page_text:

P1	Once upon a time lived a man and his two children.@He used to send his children to the market while he went to work on his farm daily for this was a time when there were no schools.
P2	During the evenings the man and his two children would eat supper together happily after the long day's work.
P3	One sunny day the two boys were walking home together from the market with some leftover fruits in a basket...when suddenly, from nowhere...!
P4	Appeared the notorious gorilla, Inkunzi.@For years he's been terrorising the village, especially in the forest paths. @Now the boys were afraid...
P5	Inkunzi the gorilla took the basket from the boys and fed himself on the fruits while the boys watched in horror.When he had finished eating all the fruits Inkunzi the gorilla ordered the boys to bring more fruits the following day
P6	The boys went home and narrated their story to their father.@In anger he hatched a plan...
P7	The following day he sent the boys once again with the basket. "Make sure you pass by the place you met Inkunzi the troubler, and give him the basket of fruits to eat, as he requested" said the father.@The boys then left as instructed.
P8	When they arrived at Inkunzi's place, he suddenly appeared from nowhere, scarring the boys.@" Give me the basket of fruits!" Roared Inkunzi@The boys handed him the basket and Inkunzi sat down to open the fruit basket.@Suddenly...
P9	Out popped out a big dog and bit him...he ran for his life and was never seen again... At least not until last week when an old man confirmed his whereabouts. @But that's the story of another day...
