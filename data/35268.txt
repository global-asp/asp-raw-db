P1	For the children in every country of Africa
P2	My name is Duma and I am ten years old.@@I live with my sister Zinhle who is thirteen years old.@@We live with Mama, Baba, our little brother Wandile, and our dog Bhubesi.
P3	Since this coronavirus came, our lives have changed. @@It is such a small virus but it can make us very sick. Any person can get very sick from this coronavirus.
P4	I am sad because I cannot play with my friends. @@Wandile is sad that he cannot hug his friends. @@Zinhle is also sad that she can't share her lip gloss with her friends.
P5	Mama is a cleaner at the hospital in town. Baba sells fruits and vegetables in town.@@Every morning they leave for work and Zinhle looks after us.
P6	Our neighbour, Gogo, is very old and has a heart problem. @@No one is allowed near her these days. The coronavirus is very dangerous for older people.@@We don't want to make her sick.
P7	After work, Mama goes to check on Gogo and brings her fresh fruits. @@Mama leaves the fruits at the door because she can't go into the house.
P8	Every morning, Zinhle goes to collect water from the nearby taps. @@Some people are wearing masks, some are not. Zinhle made a mask using her doek. @@She washes her hands at home. Mama puts hand sanitizer on our hands.
P9	Every night, Mama reminds us: @@"Wear a fresh mask every day. Wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds when you arrive anywhere. Cover your mouth and nose if you cough or sneeze."@@"Yes, Mama!" we say.
P10	1. Wash your hands with water.@2. Use soap to wash your hands.@3. Wash for 20 seconds or slowly count from 1 to 20.@4. Rinse your hands with water.@5. Dry your hands with clean towel or tissue.@6. Now your hands are clean!
