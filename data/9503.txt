page_text:

P1	In a far away town,  there lived a boy named Themba. Everyone in the town was tired of Themba breaking things and drawing on walls,  so his mum decided that farm work was the only place he would not be able to break or ruin anything. So she sent him to work at the farm with Sipho the herdsman.
P2	Early in the morning Themba and Sipho would go to the farm and look after the animals and water the crops.
P3	The more that Themba worked in the farm the more it felt like doing chaos and no longer fun. Themba started to get tired and annoyed with the place,  but Sipho would always encourage him and tell him that it can be fun.
P4	Sipho would go and play with the animals. He would feed them and talk to them. But Themba would sit and just watching,  he didn't feel like working in the farm anymore. He thought it was a waste of time for him.
P5	After seeing how much fun Sipho was having,  Themba decided to go and join in the fun.
P6	But Themba started getting carried away and what seemed like fun now felt horrible for Sipho.
P7	"Now this is fun! You were right Sipho,  working in the farm is so much fun. Hahahahah" said Themba.
P8	Themba destroyed the farm and let all the animal out of the farm and led the to town.
P9	Soon the animals were all over the town and people started shouting at Themba. Everyone new that trouble from the naughthy boy was back again. Chickens were running everywhere,  the other animals were eating and breaking things in the town. It was all a big mess.
P10	It all got out of hand and the animals started chasing Themba and the people. "Oh no,  what have i done?" said Themba.
P11	So Sipho told Themba that they have to get the animals back to the farm and clean up the place before his mum comes from work or else they will both be in big trouble. They started cleaning and fetching water to water the plants that Themba had destroyed and got all the animals back to the farm in time.
P12	In no time the garden was back to the way it was. "Thank you so much Sipho,  we had put the garden back to how it was" Themba shouted "Yesss! We did it Themba" Sipho said cheerfully.
P13	Now instead of messing the farm Themba and Sipho would sit and enjoy the Apples from the Apple tree and play with the animals. Themba never again did as he had done before,  he now listened to Sipho and realised that being at the farm can also be fun without vandalising the place.
