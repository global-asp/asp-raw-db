P10	This storybook aims to improve the reading and writing skills of 2nd and 3rd-grade students. The storybooks are complementary reading and were developed by the USAID/Learn to Red project, based on the daily lives of elementary school children.
P11	These booklets were developed by educators and illustrated by Mozambican artists. We hope that the storybooks will not only serve to consolidate reading and writing but also for students to make it part of their routines and love and enjoy reading and writing.
