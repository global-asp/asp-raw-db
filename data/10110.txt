page_text:

P1	Once upon a time,  the animals decided to have a party. But it was not for all of them. It was only for the animals that had horns.
P2	The rabbit was getting ready for the party. But then he found out that the party was not for everyone. It was just for animals with horns.
P3	The rabbit went somewhere and got some horns. Then he put them on his head and went to the party.
P4	During the party the rabbit ate and drank and danced.
P5	This made him tired and he fell down in the sun. But while the rabbit was sleeping,  the horns fell off!
P6	Then all the animals discovered that the rabbit was not the kind of animal they wanted. So they pulled his ears till they got bigger and bigger.
P7	Then they ran away. And that's the reason why rabbits have big ears!
