desc:	A story about a hard-working ox and a clever donkey.

page_text:

P1	A poor farmer had an old ox that didn't like to work. The ox didn't want to plough the farmer's field. He wanted to stay at home and eat grass, drink water and rest.
P2	The farmer had a donkey, too. The donkey and the ox were friends. At the end of the day, the ox and the donkey talked to each other. "I'm so tired," the ox said. "I worked hard all day. The plough is big and heavy. The farmer never lets me rest."
P3	The donkey thought, "The ox is lazy. He doesn't like to work." He cried, "Do you think your plough is heavy? Believe me, my friend, it is light! I carried a sack of grain on my back today. It was heavier than your plough, I am sure."
P4	The next day, the two animals met again.
"I had a bad day today," the ox said. "My
master's field is far away, and it was full
of stones. I worked hard all day. I didn't
have any rest."
P5	"You worked hard?" asked the donkey. 
"Today I travelled many kilometres to the market in the town. I'm sure I worked harder than you."
P6	The next day, the ox came home late
again. "Oh, my friend," he said to the donkey.
"Today was a very bad day for me."

But the donkey didn't want to listen to
the ox any more.
P7	He said, "You're always tired. When the farmer comes, lie down and say, ‘Moo! Moo!’ He will think that you are ill. He will let you rest."

The ox liked the donkey's idea. "Thank you, dear donkey, that's a very good idea," he said.
P8	The next morning, the ox lay down and closed his eyes. "Moo! Moo!" he said.

The farmer looked at him. "My poor old ox is sick," he said." But I must plough my field. Who will help me? Perhaps the donkey! He can pull the plough today."
P9	The farmer tied the plough to the donkey, and began to hit him with his whip. "Go on! Faster! Pull!" he called out to the donkey.

The donkey worked hard all day, and in the evening he was very tired.
P10	The donkey slowly walked home. The ox said, 
"Dear donkey, I had a lovely day today. I ate some grass, drank some water and I rested. I want to rest again tomorrow. Give me another idea."
P11	The donkey thought, "His work is much worse than mine. I don't want to do it again tomorrow." The donkey said, "Be careful. The farmer said 'My ox is always tired and now he is sick. If he is not better tomorrow, I will kill him, and we can eat the meat.'"
P12	The ox was very frightened. He cried, "Really? Did he say that? Then I will work tomorrow. I feel quite better now. I'm not tired at all!"
