page_text:

P1	The dustbin in our house stays at our backyard.
P2	We throw things at her without minding where it lands.
P3	"I am tired of you always throwing things at me." I heard her say.
P4	When we woke up the next morning, she was gone.
P5	We wondered where she could be.
P6	Then we found her. @@She said, "I don't like the way you throw things at me."
P7	'When you throw wastes at me, you hurt me."
P8	We promised that we would treat her well and never hurt her again.@@We have kept to our promise since then.
