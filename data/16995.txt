page_text:

P1	One day,   Sun and Moon argued. "I am powerful" said Sun. "I am more powerful" said Rain.
P2	The next morning,  Sun woke up very early. He was very bright and strong  the whole day. People washed all their clothes. They did not take long to dry. "I am the most powerful" said Sun.
P3	 The next day,  Rain woke up very early. It rained heavily  the whole day. People filled all their big and small containers with water. "I am the most powerful" Said Rain.
P4	In January,  Sun woke up early every day,  and shined strongly. All people got confused. All crops and grass dried up.  People felt  much thirst. Animals had no water.
P5	Every place was very hot. People looked for small rivers for swimming.
P6	In the next month,  Rain came with much  power. It rained in the morning. It rained in the afternoon,   evening and night. Every where was filled with water.
P7	 When it rained,  the weather became very cold and muddy. People had to cover themselves with long jackets and big hats.
P8	The farmers got excited,  they planted a lot of crops for food. They expected quick harvest because the crops grew very fast.
P9	After some time,  every body was fed up by the waters.  All places were full. Animals from the bush looked for safer place on a dry land.
P10	The next day,  Sun came but was very weak. Rain came but did not fall. The weather was  very cold.
P11	Every body felt very cold. No one liked the weather.
P12	People  asked each other about Sun and Rain. They wanted to tell who is more powerful. What do you think? Who is more powerful? Sun or Rain?
