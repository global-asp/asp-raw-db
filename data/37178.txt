P1	*SECTION* — MORE GAMES FOR ADDING AND SUBTRACTING@@Prerequisite: Can do single-digit addition and subtraction using manipulatives@@GAME — TARGET O's AND X's@@Use a deck with picture cards removed. Fill a tic-tac-toe board with randomly generated numbers from 1 to 20. Use a larger range if you include multiplication.@@Deal 6 cards to each player and flip them all over at the same time. For the first play, it is a race among the two players — the first player to combine two or more of their cards to match one of the squares gets to put an X there and replaces the cards they used. After that, the players take turns putting an X or an O in a chosen square whose value they can match — the cards used for the match are replaced by drawing new ones. If no match can be made, they lose their turn and can choose two of their cards to replace with new ones. The first player to get 3 in a row wins.
P2	GAME — TERMINATOR 2@@Use three dice and a board with three rows of five squares numbered from 1 to 15 . A player rolls the dice and uses addition and subtraction to combine the three numbers to match one of the numbers on the board. The matched number is crossed out and claimed. If a player can't find a match, the other player gets a chance to use the numbers and claim the result — in any event, the other player gets the next turn. The winner is the one with the most claimed numbers after a fixed number of turns.@@A smaller version would use two dice with the numbers from 1 to 10, and a larger version would use 4 dice and the numbers from 1 to 20.
P3	GAME — POISON NUMBERS@@Use a deck with the  picture cards removed – you can leave in the Queens and use them as 0's if you like. Before play starts, agree on a set of "poison" numbers for the round. The poison numbers can be any set of numbers you want your child to practice with. Some examples are: @@    • even numbers@    • odd numbers@    • primes@    • composites@    • multiples of a number, such as 3@@Each player starts with three cards. The first player discards a number that is not a poison number and replaces it from the draw pile. The next player discards a number so that the sum of the first two numbers is not a poison number and replaces the discard from the draw pile. The next player plays so that the sum of the three cards is not a poison number, and so on. The first player unable to discard a legal card loses. This game works equally well with more than two players.
P4	*SECTION* — SOLITAIRE SHAPE PUZZLES@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding small numbers@@— INTRODUCTION —@@These are one-time challenges. Let your child spend time and wrestle with these, and have the satisfaction of figuring them out.@@PUZZLE — MAGIC TRIANGLES@@Make a triangle of six circles with three circles on a side. Use the numbers from 1 to 6 so the sides have the same sum. This involves two challenges — finding which sums work and how to get those sums. Hint: the possible sums are 9, 10, 11, and 12.@@If your child enjoys this, do it for larger triangles. With four circles on a side, the sums are 17, 19, 20, 21, and 23.
P5	PUZZLE — MAGIC DESIGNS@@These are similar to the Magic Triangles puzzles. They have circles connected in a geometric pattern and an associated collection of numbers. The goal is to put the numbers in the circles so every straight line of connected circles has the same sum. The answers are in the Resources file.@@1. The numbers 1 to 4 are in a plus sign shape with no circles in common.@@2. The numbers 1 to 5 are in a plus sign with one circle in common in the middle.@@3. The numbers 1 to 7, lines of 3 circles, with one common circle in the middle.@@4. The numbers 1 to 9, lines of 3 circles, with one common circle in the middle.
P6	5. The numbers 1 to 5 in an L shape with one common circle in the corner.@@6. The numbers 1 to 8 are in a plus sign with no circles in common.@@7. The numbers 1 to 9 are in a plus sign with one circle in common in the middle.@@8. The numbers 1 to 12 are in a star shape. This has 6 directions of lines of 4 circles. Hint: The sum is 26.@@9. The numbers 1 to 7 are in an H shape - 3 vertically on the left, 1 in the center, 3 vertically on the right. The five possible lines of 3 are connected. Hint: The sum is 12.
P7	*SECTION* — MORE MENTAL MATH@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers, number bonds, skip counting, doubling@@— INTRODUCTION —@@These teaching activities introduce beginning multiplication and the power of grouping by 10's.@@— GRABBING 10's —@@Here's a fun way to make a long addition problem into a much simpler problem. Use an adding problem that has several number bonds for 10. Instead of adding 3 + 8 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 2 the usual way from left to right, rearrange the terms to put the number bonds together. This example becomes (3 + 7) + (8 + 2) + (4 + 6) + 9 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.@@Once this is easy, include trickier problems such as 4 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 3, which can be rearranged as  (8 + 9 + 3) + 4 + 5 = 20 + 9 = 29. Have your child make a habit of looking for ways to simplify long expressions to make these calculations easier.
P8	— INTRODUCTION TO MULTIPLYING —@@Your child already knows how to multiply by 2 by simply doubling. This is an exciting time when your child learns a lot more about multiplication.@@— 3 x 4 = 4 x 3 —@@By now, your child is so familiar with addition that it's no surprise that 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2. Although not as obvious, the same is true for multiplication. This illustration should make it easy to see that two rows of three is the same as three rows of two — you're just changing your point of view! It doesn't matter which order you multiply two numbers — you get the same answer either way! This means your child needs to master only about half as many multiplication facts — once your child knows 3 x 4, they also know 4 x 3.
P9	— SKIP COUNTING IS MULTIPLICATION —@@All that skip counting practice your child did paid off in getting much better at addition and subtraction. It also will be a big help in getting started with multiplication.@@Although skip counting is not the fastest way to find a result, it is reliable. Suppose your child needs to find 7 x 3. Do this by skip counting by 3's seven times or skip counting by 7's three times.@@Your child will eventually memorize these facts, but skip counting is a handy method for now.
P10	— MULTIPLYING BY 3 AND 4 —@@For someone good at adding, multiplying by 3 and 4 can be quick and easy.@@Multiplying a number by 3 is adding the number to double the number. So, 3 x 6 is 6 more than double 6, which is 6 + 12.@@Multiplying a number by 4 is doubling a number and doubling it again. So, 4 x 7 is 2 x (2 x 7), which is 14 + 14.@@— MASTERY UP TO 5 —@@At this point, your child should be comfortable quickly doing all the multiplying up to 5 times 5, which is a huge leap forward!
P11	*SECTION* — ADDING AND SUBTRACTING@@Prerequisite: Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers@@PUZZLE — SUM SQUARE —@@Start with a 3 by 3 with target sums given for each row and column. Some numbers from 1 to 9 are already placed in the grid. For the numbers that are not yet placed, the challenge is to place them to make the row and column sums be the target values.@@Make these puzzles by placing pieces of paper with the numbers from 1 to 9 on a 3 by 3 grid. For each row and column, write the sum to the right or below. Then, remove some of the numbers from the grid. Lastly, hand the pieces of paper you removed to your child and ask "where were these?"
P12	One variation that keeps the sums smaller is to use the numbers from 0 to 8 instead. A harder variation is to do the same thing with the numbers 1 to 12 in a 3 by 4 grid.@@PUZZLE — ADDITION PYRAMID@@A pyramid of 10 numbers placed in 4 rows is given with a target number. The challenge is to find a path through the pyramid using one number from each row so that the sum of the numbers is the target number. The numbers on the path must connect to each other.@@Make one of these puzzles by filling in the numbers that you want to form the path, and record the sum of those numbers. Then fill in the remaining decoy numbers in the pyramid.
P13	ACTIVITY — SUM DIFFERENCE@@One person gives two numbers, one a sum and the other a difference, and the other person is challenged to find the two numbers that have that sum and difference. For example, if one person says the sum is 12 and the difference is 6, the other person says the numbers are 3 and 9.@@Because of how easy it is to create these questions, this is a good activity to let your child be the questioner. Not all combinations of numbers for the sum and difference will produce reasonable answers. If you start with two numbers and then say their sum and difference, that will guarantee that there is an answer.@@Challenge an older child with the question of why some sums and differences have reasonable answers and others do not.
P14	*SECTION* — MAKE IT COUNT@@Prerequisite — Comfort adding and subtracting single-digit numbers@@— INTRODUCTION —@@These investigations are for your child to play with and enjoy. There is deeper mathematics involved, but your child is too young to understand that aspect. For now, let your child play with and be amazed by the patterns that occur.@@INVESTIGATION — FLOWER PETALS@@In a peculiar garden there are two kinds of flowers. One has 4 petals and the other 7 petals. A child was asked to pick some flowers so that the total number of petals was 13. Can it be done? How about 15 petals? For which numbers is it possible? For possible numbers, can it be done in more than one way? For example, 32 petals is four 7's and one 4, and it is also eight 4's.
P15	By varying the numbers, there are lots of examples to play with. For some pairs of numbers there comes a point where all numbers of petals are possible, and for other pairs of numbers there is no such point. For 4 and 7, every number from 18 on is possible. For 3 and 6, there is no point after which all numbers occur.@@INVESTIGATION — BALANCE SCALE@@A balance scale is a simple device for telling when two things have the same weight. The scale is usually supplied with a set of weights that are used to measure the weight of objects. There are some interesting investigations you can do if you restrict the weights you are allowed to use.@@For example, if you only have weights that are 4 units and 7 units, then the things you can weigh exactly are the same as you found in the flower petal investigation.
P16	What happens if you have one weight each for each of the weights in a doubling progression of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16? How many ways can you weigh something that weighs 13? What is the largest weight you can measure? This situation is related to the binary number system.@@What happens if the weights are the Fibonacci Numbers? Is there more than one way to way some weights? Find a restriction that would cause there to be only one way for each weight.
P17	INVESTIGATION — HOW MANY WAYS@@Suppose your child likes to take steps two at a time sometimes, but one at a time other times. If your child wants to go up some steps, a natural question is: How many ways can this be done?@@For example, for 0 steps there is just one way - you just stand there. For 1 step there is one way. For two steps, you can either take a one double step or two single steps.@@Your child should carefully count many cases of this and then make a table of the results (when there is lots of information, a table often helps). The start of the table would have the following numbers:@@1   1   2   3   5   8   13   21   34   55@@After looking at these numbers, your child may notice that each pair of numbers adds up to the next number. Why does this happen? These numbers are called Fibonacci Numbers.
