page_text:

P1	On top of a mountain, an elk grazes of a patch of grass, far from his herd. In a rocky den not too far from the elk, lies a wolf. This wolf hasn't eaten recently and wants a tasty meal. It sniffs the air. It calls for its pack.
P2	The elk doesn't seem to hear the howl, but instead, returns to its herd. The wolves creep down near the herd but also pick up a scent of many big and strong elk. They do not have a chance at fighting the Spike elk. They look for a calf.
P3	Wolves are carnivores, that means they munch on meat. They find deer, elk, livestock, and bison as easy prey to eat. When they fight elk, they are not very strong against a large, bull elk. The bull could easily kill the wolf and kick it.
P4	Elk are strong and dependant. They have super hard hooves to kick at wolves. They "bark"whem danger is near! They live mostly in herds of many elk. There is a male lookout elk while the others graze and truck along with the herd.
P5	The wolves creep slowly and low down through a bush. The elk spot something moving in the grass! It's a big, scary wolf! The elk bark and run away! These wolves will hurt them! The elk are scared and run faster and faster to get away.
P6	One of the big and strong elk brays and bucks its foot at one of the lower ranked wolves! It lowers its antlers and flings the wolf into a river! The wolf whimpers and trots off while the elk lightly bumps it again. The head wolf is mad.
P7	The head wolf growls and barks at the elk. The elk doesn't care. It keeps kicking with it's hard hooves. Finally, the wolves start ripping at the elk's leg. The elk tries to fling and shake the wolf brutally off its leg and back to a river.
P8	The elk is done for. The elk ia very hurt now, so it lies down for a few seconds as tje wolves grab and tear at it. Soon, the elk is hunted. The wolves howl and the head wolves eat first. Then, the lower ranked. It was a brutal hunt.
