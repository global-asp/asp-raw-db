page_text:

P1	There was a boy named Mike. Mike was six years old. Mike was crying because he couldn't go for Fred's birthday party without his shoes.
P2	Mike's mum shouted at him for misplacing his new shoes and said that he wouldn't leave unless he found his shoes. He searched and searched but only found the two left legs of different shoes.
P3	Mike saw a floating man and asked who he was. "I am a genie" he said "Can I get a wish then?" Mike asked "Yes,  but be careful what you wish for" He warned. Mike wished for two left legs so that he could wear the shoes and go for the party.
P4	The genie granted him his wish and he was able to wear his shoes. Mike thanked the genie and got up but he found out that he could not walk with two left feet. Mike begged the genie to change it back but the genie refused and flew away. Mike missed his party. When his mum found out what happened,  she cried because she had just found the right legs of his shoes. Mike could not walk again. Mike learnt his lesson. MORAL LESSON: Be careful what you wish for and always be patient.
