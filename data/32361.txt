page_text:

P1	Rungo was a truck driver from Mabote.
P2	When he was about 35, he began to get sick.
P3	He went to see a traditional healer, which cost a lot of money.
P4	The healer pulled some strange things out of his stomach.
P5	Then Rungo felt better for a while, but he couldn't work.
P6	So he went with his son to the clinic to be tested for HIV.
P7	They were both tested. The son was negative, but Rungo was positive.
P8	The clinic gave him the medicine he needed, and it was free.
P9	But for the first few weeks the medicine made him very sick.
P10	His wife said he should stop taking it.
P11	She got him some Chinese medicine, which cost even more money.
P12	But he kept on taking the pills from the clinic.
P13	Slowly Rungo got better, and now he is driving a truck again.
