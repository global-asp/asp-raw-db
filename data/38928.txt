P1	——Dumisani is writing an article for his school magazine.He is interviewing children at his school about their experiences of the Covid pandemic.He goes to talk to learners during break.
P2	“What did you think when you first heard about the Corona virus?” asks Dumisani.“A lot of people believe what they see, not what they hear. At the beginning, some said this virus didn’t exist,” says Moses.
P3	Moses continues, “Some people didn’t want to follow the rules. I told them, we all have to follow the pandemic rules, because if we don’t, the virus is not going anywhere...”“At home and in the community, we followed the rules!” interrupts Zwanga.
P4	Zwanga is Moses’ twin brother. Moses looks at Zwanga.“Are you serious?” asks Moses.“I’m not saying all of the people in the community, but some of them!” protests Zwanga.The rest of the learners laugh. It was the same for everyone.
P5	“There were lots of rules and regulations!” moans Zwanga.He continues, “Don’t touch your face, don’t touch your nose, don’t touch your mouth, don’t go in a crowded bus. Wash your hands, sanitise, wear a mask, social distance…”Zwanga runs out of breath.
P6	Moses says, “Eish, the first lockdown was the worst!”Dumisani asks the group, “How did you deal with lockdown?”Mpho answers, “It wasn’t great! All you did was sit at home and watch TV. At first, you couldn’t even go outside.”
P7	“It was hard to study at home because there is a lot of noise,” says Basani.“I was alone. I wanted someone to explain the work I was given,” says Bongi.“I was also suffering a lot with my schoolwork,” says Mpho.
P8	“So, were you happy when they re-opened the schools?” asks Dumisani.“My thought of going back to classes was that it wasn’t safe enough to go to school,” replies Andzani.Abdul agrees, “Us as learners might not follow the regulations or we might forget.”
P9	“I didn’t think the schools should re-open,” says Basani.Mpho says, “I was so glad to come back to the classroom, back to school.”“Me too!” says Moses, and Zwanga nods his head.“What is different at school now?” asks Dumisani.
P10	Moses begins, “Only one thing has changed at school since the COVID-19 pandemic and that is …”“… that everything has changed!” Zwanga completes his brother’s sentence.Their friends laugh and agree. The school bell rings and it’s time for class.
