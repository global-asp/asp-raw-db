page_text:

P1	This is Vusi. @He is from another village. @He has a very big family. He is the oldest of seven children.
P2	This is their new RDP house. It is on the edge of the village.@Today is his first day at school. He is very happy as he walks to school.
P3	On the map you see the way Vusi goes to school and the way another child goes to school. @Which statement is true?@@-Vusi’s way is longer@-Vusi’s way is twice as long@-The other child’s way is longer@-The other child’s way is shorter
P4	Now Vusi sits in the classroom. He likes playing with numbers. He likes it a lot when he adds, takes away, divides, or multiplies numbers.
P5	The teacher, Miss Masilela, divides the children into groups. But nobody wants to work with Vusi.
P6	Vusi is very sad and works on his own.
P7	When the day is over, the children rush outside. @It is one o‘clock.
P8	Vusi sits in a corner. Some children are playing games. Some children are eating food.
P9	Sad that he has no new friends, Vusi sits in the corner. A boy named Themba comes to Vusi, looks at him and laughs. „You are alone and have nothing to eat and I have a cheese sandwich.“@A girl from the class rushes to Vusi to help him.
P10	She gives Themba an angry look. „You should not laugh at anyone, that is mean.“ The other students agree with her and look angrily at Themba. „Hello, I am Nomalanga. Can I sit with you?“ Vusi smiles at her, happy that he has a friend now.
P11	Another child tells Miss Masilela what happened. Miss Masilela calls all the children in the class to Vusi and says:
P12	„I have an idea. Let’s all share our snacks with each other.“
P13	The students like this idea and share their food.
P14	They cut a banana into quarters, Themba’s cheese sandwich into half and a small cake into eight pieces.
P15	After this day the class come together once a week and share their food.
