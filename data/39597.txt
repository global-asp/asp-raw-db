P1	Ugo and Ifeanyi wẹre very close friends. They had all things in common and attended the same college.@@Once upọn a time Ugo decided to visit hẹr Aunty in a nearby village after school in company of Ifeanyi hẹr best friend.
P2	Ugo and hẹr friend had spent sọ.much time with her Aunty that they never realised that it was dusk. The Aunty advised them to sleep with her since it was already NIGHT but both had exams in school the next day, sọ set out to return home.
P3	They both strolled the narrow path as they returned home. Nature appeared to be gracious to them as the moon did not fail to beam it's brilliant light on their path. Ugo and Ifeanyi wẹre hastily walking down the path to get home .
P4	Suddenly a Leopard ran out of a nearby bush and broke the nature silence; advancing menancingly towards Ugo and Ifeanyi. They did not know what to dọ. Immediately Ifeanyi quickly climbed a nearby tree leaving hẹr friend, Ugo alone.
P5	Ugo who was visibly afraid and helpless decided to lie flat on rhe ground seizing hẹr breath to feign that she was dead. The Leopard got to where Ugo laid down , walked round hẹr smelling her body and nose thinking that she was dead, left.
P6	Ifeanyi who was watching from the tree top,came down having observed that the Leopard had jumped into the nearby bush. Ugo stood still wondering how God had saved hẹr. What happened?Ifeanyi querried. Leopards do not feed on dead animals.
P7	What did the Leopard tell you?Ifeanyi asked in an attempt to win hẹr friend back. Ugo responded, the Leopard said: "Do not keep an unfaithful friend for a friend in nẹed is a friend indeed".
