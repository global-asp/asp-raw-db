P1	I wake up. My mom says i'm late for school so i run as fast as i can, get ready and go to school. There, i learn about Science, Math and English. On break, i talk to my friend, Haiqa. On the walk back home, i think about how nice my friends are and how i never want to leave them.
P2	When i go back to my house, my mom says she has something to tell me. @- Larissa, we are going to live in  Nigeria.@- What?@How did all the plans for my life changed in one second? @- We are leaving tomorrow.@- No!
P3	We arrive in Abuja. I don't understand anything they are saying. My father can speak English but me and my mom just know the basics. How am i going to interact with people?
P4	On my first day in school, i don't understand anything. Why did i even have to come here anyways?
P5	Two months later, i feel good being in school! I understand them and they understand me. It's really good to be accepted.
P6	How did everything changed in two months? I still in touch with my friends in Brazil and they always ask me how do i talk to people here. But i honestly don't know.
P7	Life in Abuja is not that  bad. I have my friends and that's all i care about.
