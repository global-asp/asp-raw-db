page_text:

P1	Today is my 13th birthday but to be honest I don't care.  My mom knows something is wrong but she wont dare ask. Nobody wants my trouble. My friends and I have been labeled as the "bad gang of Chibok". We do all the things that nobody in my town will even consider doing. I wake up and wear my uniform. I leave my bed undressed and walk out of my house, without even bothering to greet my mother. I may be wearing my uniform but I am definitely not going to school today.
P2	I walk to the abandoned building, behind the school, to meet my friends. @I meet Zahra, Mohammed, Ahmed, and Leilah on the top floor. We all greet each other.@"Ehe! What evil or challenging thing should we do today?" Ahmed asks.@"Let's break into the bank and steel!" Zahra suggests.@"Let's beat up one of the village elders!" Leila says.@"No! I know exactly what we should do. Let's go to the Sambisa forest," Mohammed says with an evil grin.
P3	We all gasp. Zahra screams. @Ever since we were kids we were trained not to even say the name yet alone go to the forest.@Mamma will definately kill me if I dare take on  this task. @I shrug. @"I think we should do it," Ahmed says acting like it is no big deal.@Since he is the leader of our group they all agree.@"When should we go?' Leilah asks.@"Tomorrow. At 3pm all of you should come to this building prepared! Meeting over! Go and do whatever you want." Ahmed yells.
P4	I walk to the market and find a quite place.@I worry and worry and worry. @Should I do it? Should I go with them? Is it worth the risk?@Boko Haram is there. I might die.@What if they get me?@I usually dont care about what Mama ways but I honestly don't think this is a good idea. @As I walk home, I make up my mind. @I am going to go. Not because I want to, but to prove a point. I may live in a poor district but I can do whatever I want.
P5	The next morning I prepare my things. Ahmed said we might spend the night there. I walk out o the house with my suitcase. Mama doesn't even ask where I am going. I rarely ever sleep at home. @I walk to the abandoned building and meet everyone looking nervous, except for Ahmed of-course. @Ahmed checks his watch. It is 2:59. One more minute.@One minute later, Ahmed stands up. "It's time to go," he says.
P6	We walk for ages.@We talk a little but we can barely focus on the conversation most of us are to worried about what we are getting ourselves into. We reach a patch of green and then we reach a row of trees.@We are here.
P7	We walk in. But as we walk, something grabs my leg. "AGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH," I scream, "Help Me! Somebody help me!"@My friends turn to look at me and they laugh. Then they continue walking, and they leave me there, stuck to the ground.@I cant believe these people are supposed to be my friends.
P8	I stay there trying to avoid the snake. On my sixth attempt to escape from the snake, it bites me. I scream in pain. I am dying. This is my end. It bites again and I close my eyes slowly, never to see the world again.@THE END.
