Play with them because they can talk

page_text:

P1	Trees, trees, trees as they are seen thier friendship is evergreen.@We can play under them all day staying there makes our feelings easier to convey.@ Please let them stay; so don't fray.@Keep them clean; don't let them lean.
P2	In the end I would like to say:@Keep them alive;@They keep you alive.
